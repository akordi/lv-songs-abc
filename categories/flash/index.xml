I feel so sad and insecure, Facing my problems. Then you just turned and smiled at me And everything was so clear Boy, I realized that we were meant to be. In your arms I feel so warm and safe inside, hold me tighter, In your eyes I see the wonder and surprise for all my life. When I feel blue You know the way to make me Smile again, I’ m pretty sure you know.</description></item></channel></rss>
