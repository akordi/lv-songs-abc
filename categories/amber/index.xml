So I wanna know your name, And I’d love to see you around, And I wanna make you feel Like you never did before. Let your body move to the music, And let this stay forever, Let your body move to the music As long as we dance together.</description></item><item><title>Fly Away With You</title><link>http://example.org/song/3338-Amber__-_Fly_Away_With_You/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Mar 2018 19:57:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/song/3338-Amber__-_Fly_Away_With_You/</guid><description>Let’s fly away, Fly away with you. I had a dream of Puerto Rico, Of having little fun. I had a dream that I could find you, My dream has just begun, just begun. I want to fly away to the Mexican coast, I want to fly away when nobody knows, I want to fly away with the dream of my soul, I want to fly away with you. Let’s fly away, Fly away with you.</description></item></channel></rss>
