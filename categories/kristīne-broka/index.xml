You can sing this angel’s song, You can hear it all day long, I’m yours, every inch, Within your reach. To the best of my memory Angel’s songs singing finally To the best of my memory. Angel’s eyes seeing finally To the best of my memory, Memory.</description></item><item><title>License for Love</title><link>http://example.org/song/3364-Kristine_Broka_-_License_For_Love/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Mar 2018 19:03:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/song/3364-Kristine_Broka_-_License_For_Love/</guid><description>When the amber sea sounds a call, I send for you my little dream ball, I want to see you always behind, My luck haunts the back of my mind. I will give you license for love, I hope you to look in my life, To tempt you more and more in every way, This is my true red-letter day. I will give you license for love, I will give you reason to live, When amber sun goes down, down on me, This land is meant for you and me.</description></item></channel></rss>
