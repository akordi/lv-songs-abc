Helped to clean the Central Park

Went to desert, made it rain
        Am
Swam through a shark tank bloodily
         F
Found Atlantis, by the way
       C
But today

            Gm                                    C
I've got a cake to bake, and haven't done that before
           F                         A

I talked to a unicorn the other night
        Dm
Took me up on a lonely star
         C
Did the moonwalk on the milky way
    F   
Realized I've gone too far
      Dm
So I questioned the law of gravity
        Gm
Put the apple back up to the apple tree
       Am
Ej tu nost: I even learned Latvian

I know it's so hard to believe
