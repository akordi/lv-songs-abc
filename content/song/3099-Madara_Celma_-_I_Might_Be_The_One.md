```text
You may close, close every door if you dare
You may turn, turn out the lights
And pretend you’re not there
You can try to forget about me, but please
Stop before you do

‘Cause I might be your only shelter
Might be the one who always stands for you
All you have to do is call my name in silence
And I will run to you like I have wings

I don’t and I won’t believe that you’re gonna leave
Look at me, stay with me
Feel the flame burning in me, in your eyes
Still I can see how much you need me
Please, stop before you go

‘Cause I might be your only shelter
Might be the one who always stands for you
All you have to do is call my name in silence
And I will run to you like I have wings

‘Cause I might be your only shelter
Might be the one who always stands for you
All you have to do is call my name in silence
And I will run to you like I have wings

You gave me wings
