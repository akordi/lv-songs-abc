Tonight we pack our bags, tonight were leaving town
Lets hit the road
Get ready for a trip, you wont forget about
Ready to go?

This weekend we will party hard without a doubt
Have the time of our lives

Now were leavin everything behind us, baby
Have a little fun
Now were leaving everything behind us, baby
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Upside down, we turn the world around
Inside out, were going crazy
Upside down, we wont hit the ground

Upside down, oh oh oh
Inside out, oh oh oh
Upside down, oh oh oh
We wont hit the ground

The getaway we want and always dream about
Right by our feet
The party never stops, its going day and night
Come and turn up the heat

Now were leavin everything behind us, baby
Have a little fun
Now were leaving everything behind us, baby
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Upside down, we turn the world around
Inside out, were going crazy
Upside down, we wont hit the ground

Upside down, oh oh oh
Inside out, oh oh oh
Upside down, oh oh oh
We wont hit the ground

Welcome to Latvia
Latvia, douze points
Its better than good
Its gonna be upside down

Upside down, we turn the world around
Inside out, were going crazy
Upside down, we wont hit the ground

Upside down, we turn the world around
Inside out, were going crazy
Upside down, we wont hit the ground

Upside down, oh oh oh
Inside out, oh oh oh
Upside down, oh oh oh
We wont hit the ground
