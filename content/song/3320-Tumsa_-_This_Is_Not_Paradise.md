```text
Just a minute ago I thought that I’m
Just one step to a place called paradise

Just a minute ago I thought that you’re
An angel face in paradise

In paradise
When you say no, no, no, no, no
Lies are all you’ve got

This is not paradise
This is not paradise
When you say la la la la la
I’m just teasing you, my pal

Just a minute ago you saw me hot
With dog kind eyes staring in paradise
Just a minute ago you took me high
To make me dream of paradise

Of paradise
When you say no, no, no, no, no
Lies are all you’ve got

This is not paradise
This is not paradise
When you say la la la la la
I’m just teasing, I’m just teasing you

Just a minute ago I thought that I’m
Just one step to a place called paradise
Called paradise
Called paradise
Called paradise
