```text
Last night
I looked up to the sky
Searching for the fire
That left heart of mine
But i did not find

The sun will dawn
As fast as will be gone
And I will drown
With all I never found

It's hard to stay Believer
If the darkness gives you shivers
Hard to clear the clouds

This fight
Won't leave us alive
It will feed your ire
As a mean good-bye
On a lonely isle

It's hard to stay Believer
If the darkness gives you shivers
Hard to clear the clouds
To let the sunlight out
It's hard to be forgiven
To live with all's been given
Easier pass out

It's hard to be forgiven
To live with all's been given
Easier pass out

It's hard to stay Believer
Hard to be forgiven
Easier pass out
```
