Gm Em

There was a lantern, hung in a tree
So full of fear, it could have been me

Dream tangerine, showed us the way
I kissed a girl, I remember this day
I remember the summers
As we sing in the fall
Happy to be with you,
Want to take you all
Sending love to the moon boy
From the birds of our hands
Sending love to the moon boy
From the marching band

Good spirit come, with the queen of clowns
Take us for a ride, on a magic bus
Walkman and watchmen, they had a fight
Walkman beat the watchmen
Now the bus takes flight

I remember the summers
As we sing in the fall
Happy to be with you,
Want to take you all
Sending love to the moon boy
From the birds of our hands
Sending love to the moon boy
From the marching band.
