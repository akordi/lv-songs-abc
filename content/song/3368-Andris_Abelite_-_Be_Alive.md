```text
All of those thinks I say today
Sounds familiar and close
All of those thinks I feel feel today
Makes me be more serious and real

All I want is to see your eyes
All I want is to be then alive

Be alive forever
Be alive and tender
Be alive forever, be alive
Now here with me

Ba alive forever
Be alive and tender

All of those thinks that I have told you
Made you maden calm for long
All the thinks I felt today and before
On and on again in your arms

All I want is to see your eyes
All I want is to be then alive

Be alive forever
Be alive and tender
Be alive forever, be alive
Now here with me

Ba alive forever
Be alive and tender

Be alive forever
Be alive and tender
Be alive forever, be alive
Now here with me

Ba alive forever
Be alive and tender
