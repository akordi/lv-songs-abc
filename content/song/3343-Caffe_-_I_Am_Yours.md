```text
And again it’s the night
When my thoughts are with you
Actually, they are there every day
Every minute I am trying to get them away
But they are coming and coming

I’m feeling sad
I’m feeling that every night
You are my light, my light in the dark
I miss you and I need you

‘Cause you are the only one who understands me
Believe in me, it hurts to know that you are here
Close but not with me, close but not with me
You are the only one

‘Cause you are the only one who understands me
Believe in me, it hurts to know that you are here
Close but not with me, close but not with me
You are the only one

And again the sun goes down
And I know what to do
Things around look beautiful
And I will give to you that all
But I am falling and falling

For I don’t know why
Oh, I don’t know why do I cry
You are my light, my light in the dark
I miss you and I need you

‘Cause you are the only one who understands me
Believe in me, it hurts to know that you are here
Close but not with me, close but not with me
You are the only one

‘Cause you are the only one who understands me
Believe in me, it hurts to know that you are here
Close but not with me, close but not with me
You are the only one

It was so good to hear your voice
To hear your thoughts, to feel your thoughts
But you always hide the truth
‘Cause I love you

‘Cause you are the only one who understands me
Believe in me, it hurts to know that you are here
Close but not with me, close but not with me
You are the only one

Close but not with me, close but not with me
You are the only one
Close but not with me, close but not with me
You are the only one
