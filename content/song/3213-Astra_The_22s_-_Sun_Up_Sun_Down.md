Black bullet's left, take a shot
Got nothing, nothing's been got
Hunt you down, make it look easy
 
Promises don't mean nothing
Don't need your two-faced loving
I was born on a mountain, baby
 
I want it, I want it from down below
I want it, I want it cut to the bone
I want it, I want it, keep counting down
I want it, I want it, gonna take you out
I want it, I want it, gonna blow your mind
I want it, I want it, shut down your fences, keep on running baby
 
Sun up or sun
Sun up or sun
Sun up or sun down
Sun up or sun
Sun up or sun
Sun up or sun down
 
The answer cuts through half your heart
Sun up or sun down
Sun up or sun down
 
Take it all to say goodbye
Keep living, but you want to die
Sleep tight, don't make a sound
 
I want it, I want it from down below
I want it, I want it cut to the bone
I want it, I want it, keep counting down
I want it, I want it, gonna take you out
I want it, I want it, gonna blow your mind
I want it, I want it, shut down your fences, keep on running baby
 
Sun up or sun
Sun up or sun
Sun up or sun down
Sun up or sun
Sun up or sun
Sun up or sun down
 
The answer cuts through half your heart
Sun up or sun down
Sun up or sun down
 
This wish is here, but I got no regrets
No shame, no pride, it's all been left behind
No water to wash away your face
 
The answer cuts through half your heart
Sun up or sun down
Sun up or sun down
 
The answer cuts through half your heart
Sun up or sun down
Sun up or sun down
 
Sun up or sun
Sun up or sun
Sun up or sun down
Sun up or sun
Sun up or sun
Sun up or sun down
 
The answer cuts through half your heart
Sun up or sun down
Sun up or sun down
 
Down
