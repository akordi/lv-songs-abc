[Am] When I open up a [F] page of my past
[G] I find it [Am] blue â€“
[Am] Love enough for two [F] but no-one around,
[G] Nothing to [Am] do.

[Am] I found no [F] no meaning
[G] In the world at [E] all
[Am] Bravehearted [F] I started
[G] Knocking on your [E] wall

  And you [Am] came
  And you [F] came
  [G] Showing me a whole new [C] world
  And you [Am] came
  And you [F] came
  [G] I will never be the [E] same
  And you [Am] came
  Like a flame
  That I [F] hope will never die
  [G] Showing me a whole new [C] world
  And you [Am] came
  And you came
  And you [F] got me outta frame
  [G] I will never be the [E] same

[Am] When I open up a [F] page of my past
[G] I find it [Am] white
[Am] Now it's getting clear the [F] colours appear
[G] Out of your [Am] light 

[Am] The freedom
[F] I cherished
[G] Was a fool's para[E]dise
[Am] But when I [F] met you
I [G] got huma[E]nized

  And you [Am] came
  Like a [F] flame
  [G] Showing me a whole new [C] world
  And you [Am] came
  And you [F] came
  [G] I will never be the [E] same
  And you [Am] came
  Like a flame
  That I [F] hope will never die
  [G] Showing me a whole new [C] world
  And you [Am] came
  And you came
  And you [F] got me outta frame
  [G] I will never be the [E] same

[Am] My shelter [F] and my shooting [G] star
That's [E] what you are to me
[Am] You made my [F] life [G] complete (so [E] complete)
[Am] It feels so [F] good
The past is [G] gone
The [E] past is done
[Am] No white, no [F] blue 
[G] I'll stay with [E] you (stay with you)

  And you [Am] came
  And you [F] came
  [G] Showing me a whole new [C] world
  And you [Am] came
  And you [F] came
  [G] I will never be the [E] same
  And you [Am] came
  Like a [F] flame
  [G] Showing me a whole new [C] world
  And you [Am] came
  And you [F] came
  [G] I will never be the [E] same

  And you [Am] came
  And you [F] came
  [G] Showing me a whole new [C] world
  And you [Am] came
  And you [F] came
  [G] I will never be the [E] same
  And you [Am] came
  Like a [F] flame
  [G] Showing me a whole new [C] world
  And you [Am] came
  And you [F] came
  [G] I will never be the [E] same

  And you [Am] came
