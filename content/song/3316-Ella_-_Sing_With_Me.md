Things haven’t been the same since you came into my life
You are playing with my mind, and you don’t see the pain I feel
I don’t wanna tell a lie, this is something I can’t hide
Without you I can’t survive, thinkin’ about you all the time

Sing with me, sing with me
Sing with me, sing with me
Sing with me, sing with me
Sing with me, sing with me

Sing with me, sing with me
Sing with me, sing with me
Sing with me, sing with me
Sing with me

No one said: Love is gonna be so easy
Trust in me, listen to the words I say
Stay with me until the stars fall down from the sky
My heart is yours now for real and for sure
(For real and for sure)

Sing with me, sing with me
Sing with me, sing with me
Sing with me, sing with me
Sing with me, sing with me

Sing with me, sing with me
Sing with me, sing with me
Sing with me, sing with me
Sing with me, sing with me

Sing with you, about the true, where you at and what you do
Is it me that you need? What I need is you
Now I’m lost in my passion, because you show no reaction
Every and each of my actions is for your satisfaction

All over the world drop the mic for you
Say you feel the same, say you feel me too
Cause you look like, you move like
Each thing you do goes through my mind like
Sing behind the beat

Sing with me, sing with me (Sing with me)
Sing with me, sing with me (All over the world)
Sing with me, sing with me (We’ll fly till we die, so far, so high)
Sing with me, sing with me (So far, so high)

Sing with me, sing with me (You and me)
Sing with me, sing with me (To our destiny)
Sing with me, sing with me (Never was afraid to be me, to be free)
Sing with me, sing with me

Sing with me, sing with me (sing with me)
Sing with me, sing with me (all over the world)
Sing with me, sing with me (we’ll fly till we die, so far, so high)
Sing with me, sing with me (so far, so high)
Sing with me, sing with me (you and me)
Sing with me, sing with me (to our destiny)
Sing with me, sing with me (never was afraid to be me, to be free)
Sing with me, sing with me
