   F        G                         Em    Am
You said some words, didn't hear you fall asleep
   F        G                         Em    Am
People were talking louder from my TV screan
   F        G                         Em    Am
I heard them scream, it was too dark to see...

   F      G          
Don't cry, I'll try to
       Em                      Am
say the right words at the right times.
         F        G
Sing you lullabies,
   Em     Am
Please, don't wake up, wake up...

   F        G                         Em    Am 
You still think we live in world so beautiful,
         F                G                    Em    Am 
You see, I think I don't believe in this stuff anymore...
 
   F      G          
Don't cry, I'll try to
       Em                      Am
say the right words at the right times.
         F        G
Sing you lullabies,
   Em     Am
Please, don't wake up, wake up...
 
   F      G          
Don't cry, I'll try to
       Em                      Am
say the right words at the right times.
         F        G
Sing you lullabies,
   Em     Am
Please, don't wake up, wake up...

   F
Please, don't make me wait.
G
Don't make me wait...
 Em
Please!(don't make me wait) 
 Am
Don't wake up, wake up...(don't make me wait) 

F   G  Em  Am
