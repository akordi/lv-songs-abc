```text
Capo 3
Em Am Em G Em Am Em

Em                           Am
All alone in a crowded place
                   Em
Everyone on their way
G            Em  Am  Em
Going nowhere

Lawyers beggars and busy businessmen
All worshipping some kind of colored
Chinese paper

Can cut my ears off
And pull my eyes out
To fit right in

The more you think and calculate
The more confusion there is
To be left

The further we go the more we forget
What it was all about
In the rise

It sometimes it annoys to be sane
In this insane world, we eat, sleep and reproduce
But maybe I will be just fine
And I will be just fine
```
