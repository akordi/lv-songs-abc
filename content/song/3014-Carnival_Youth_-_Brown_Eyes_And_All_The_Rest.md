Intro(2x)
C# G# D# D#
C# Ab Bb Bb


Db       Ab  Eb
What if I push myself
Db       Ab    Bb
What if I try to do it all by myself
Db          Ab    Eb
You and I could see for ourselves
Db            Ab    Bb
With our brown eyes and all the rest

Db               Cm
My heart's too old to survive this storm
Fm              Eb
Yours too bold to give a rest
Db               Cm
So I'll just try to do my best
Fm            Eb
And let the time do the rest



Chorus 

Db               C             Fm
And let the storm salt the sea
        Ab
Or perform a wicked heresy
Bbm              C             Fm
To our hearts and to our minds
                Ab
I'll be there with you

Stay calm


Db Ab Eb Eb
Db Ab Bb Bb

Db           Ab  Eb 
I would never dare to look at you
Db      Ab   Bb
For the fear you would see me through
Db               Ab     Eb
Cause love and care is that made my heart
Db               Ab     Bb
Cause love and care is that tore it apart


Db               Cm
My heart's too old to survive this storm
Fm              Eb
Yours too bold to give a rest
Db               Cm
So I'll just try to do my best
Fm            Eb
And let the time do the rest



Db               C             Fm
And let the storm salt the sea
Ab
Or perform a wicked heresy
Bbm              C             Fm
To our hearts and to our minds
              Ab
I'll be there with you

Stay calm


Db               C             Fm
And let the storm salt the sea
      Ab
Or perform a wicked heresy
Bbm              C             Fm
To our hearts and to our minds
             Ab
I'll be there, but you stay

Db           Ab  Eb
And let the storm salt the sea (take us home)

Or perform heresy (take us home)
Db       Ab  Eb
To our hearts and to our minds
Db       Ab  Bb                 Db
Your brown eyes and all the rest
