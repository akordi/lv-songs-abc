```text
When city lights turned into shadows
I found you standing there alone
Your jeans were torn your heart was broken
You couldn't get back to your feet

  No matter were we could find the light
  We made the shadows turn into light
  Two different worlds will collide
  We've spent long nights in this town

And if i want to take you with me
Would you say yes of all for me
There is no way back just road ahead us
Decisions coming back and forth

  No matter were we could find the light
  We made the shadows turn into light
  Two different worlds will collide
  We spent long nights in this town

we had it all, and i feel so lost
We had it all and i feel so lost
```
