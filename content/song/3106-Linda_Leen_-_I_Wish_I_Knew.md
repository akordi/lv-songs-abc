```text
Everytime you’re walking by I feel like flying high
But then I realize: The blue is in your eyes
Telling you how much I care makes you stop, sit and stare
So then I walk away and you don’t make me stay

Your hesitation seems too long
So in all confusion I wrote you this song

I wish I knew what should I do
To make the sun shine, to make you all mine
Here is my heart, don’t break it apart
Look in my eyes and read: It’s you that I need

My mind says stop to dream and row another stream
And walk another land and try to understand
My heart beats only for you, and yours? What will it do?
I’m hoping you would say: It’s beating in my way

Your hesitation seems too long
And in all confusion I wrote you this song (wrote you this song)

Oh, I wish I knew what should I do
To make the sun shine, to make you all mine
Here is my heart, don’t break it apart
Look in my eyes and read: It’s you that I need

Give me words to open your smile to me
Send me seconds that suddenly will make you see
Let the time tick your hand in my hand
May the music mark our happy end

I wish I knew what should I do
To make the sun shine, to make you all mine
Here is my heart, don’t break it apart
Look in my eyes and read: It’s you that I need

I wish I knew what should I do
To make the sun shine, to make you all mine.
Here is my heart, don’t break it apart,
Look in my eyes and read: It’s you that I need.

Here is my heart, here is my heart,
Don’t break it apart, don’t break it apart
