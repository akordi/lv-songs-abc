    Am7
I'm reading your letters
    Dm7
I hope you are mine
      G/C                  Fmaj 7            
You say that you're always fine,
            Am7             Dm          G           F
But if you feel sad you can reach me online
   Am7
I hope you are better,
     Dm7
I'll meet you at nine
    G/C           Fmaj7
You will say that you're always fine
Am7                       Dm                      G          F
But if you still feel sad you can reach me online

E   Am                 G                              C
            Will you come with me to that place
E   Am                    G                         C
            Where heaven meens the sea
E   Am                 G                         C
            We'll be standing face to face
E    Am                                G          Am
            No mobile phones, so free, so free, so free....

PANTS || Am7 | Dm7 | G/C | Fmaj7 | Am7 | Dm | G | F ||
    
         Am7
And you and you and you
     Dm7    
What would you say if someone comes to you and asks
  G/C                  Fmaj 7        
"What is Your favourite dream?",
  Am7             Dm       G           F
...and I would answer - "to see HER on my screen"
      Am7             Dm7
"All right", he would say,
      G/C                    Fmaj7
"then find a real password - a key to her heart,
        Am7                          Dm
Its not too simple, it's not too smart", and then
      G                  F
Your dream will be saved forever...
