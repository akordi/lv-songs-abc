```text
We’ll meet each other next summer ’cause it was so cold this winter
We’ll have a chance to start, to fall apart again and again
Again and again and again and again and again and again

You look like a girlfriend right from the backyard
I’m just a stupid boy from next door
Please never release me from that house
I’m gonna be nice and quiet, quiet like a mouse

Don’t ever believe me ’cause I’m a child
Don’t even try to feed me
But you, you can delete me from your house
Even if it hurts me again and again, and again

You look like a girlfriend right from the backyard
I’m just a stupid boy from next door
Please never release me from that house
I’m gonna be nice and quiet, quiet like a mouse

We have never started the love
That always comes from backyard
But we always knew the meaning of true love

You look like a girlfriend right from the backyard
I’m just a stupid boy from next door
Please never release me from that house
I’m gonna be nice and quiet, quiet like a mouse
