Everybody needs somebody
We know it, we’re always searching for someone
Every day I feel like naughty
A man in the station whose train has gone

But then like a star she comes to my day
She’s flicker and flicker and making me crazy
I’ll over and over again
Over and over and over again

She’s a queen, and nothing else but a queen
And nothing less that between, you see how she moves
She’s a queen, oh nothing else but a queen
And nothing less that between

Yes she’s a queen, with eyes like a flame
I melt at her gaze
This moment of time she comes to my day
I’ll over and over and over again

She’s a queen, and nothing else but a queen
And nothing less that between, you see how she moves
She’s a queen, oh nothing else but a queen
And nothing less that between

Over and over and over again

She’s a queen, most beautiful girl in the world
Most beautiful girl ever seen
And nothing else but a queen
Most beautiful girl ever seen
