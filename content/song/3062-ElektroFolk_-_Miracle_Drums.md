Hey, let’s dance a war dance
Don’t you wanna have fun?
Since the world wants even more fun
You have got to get a gun (A big gun)

Since the rhythm of the war drums
Grows stronger in our minds
All the other sounds are drowned out
Hearts turn into stones, eyes are made blind

When the beat of war drums is all the world hears
And it’s ready to destroy what it truly holds dear
We will play drums for them to hear as well
Miracle drums, miracle drums

Love, love in your heart
Love, love in your soul
Love will bring you home
Miracle drums, miracle drums

Love, love in your heart
Love, love in your soul
Love will bring you home
Miracle drums, miracle drums

The drums will call for fighters
And call them back home
To be fairytale writers
And painters of souls

The fighters will then again be lovers
They will come back again to be fathers
They will start loving their sons and daughters
Can you hear the drums, the miracle drums?
Can you hear the drums, the miracle drums?

Love, love in your heart
Love, love in your soul
Love will bring you home
Miracle drums, miracle drums

Love, love in your heart
Love, love in your soul
Love will bring you home
Miracle drums, miracle drums

(Love, love in your heart) Love in your heart
(Love, love in your soul) In your soul
(Love will bring you home)
Miracle drums, miracle drums

(Love, love in your heart) Love in your heart
(Love, love in your soul) In your soul
(Love will bring you home)
Miracle drums, miracle drums
Miracle drums, miracle drums
