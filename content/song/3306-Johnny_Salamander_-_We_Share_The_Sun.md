I don’t know what is right,
I don’t know what is wrong.
I just want to know where I belong.

Is it here where I stand
Or do I have to think bigger?
Maybe the whole world is in a reach of a hand.

I feel the future’s so much brighter than today,
All we have to do is go the right way,
Right way, right way, right way, right way.

We have to be together, we have to be as one,
We share the ground beneath, we share the sun.
We have to be together, we have to be as one,
We share the ground beneath, we share the sun.

Hey, you listen what I’ve gotta say,
Mother Earth is in danger,
We have to save it now before it’s to late.

You don’t know how, I don’t know what,
Let’s put our minds together,
We have to try to save what we’ve got.

I can see our children playing games and having fun,
To make it happen there is just one thing that should be done,
Be done, be done, be done, be done.

We have to be together, we have to be as one,
We share the ground beneath, we share the sun.
We have to be together, we have to be as one,
We share the ground beneath, we share the sun.

We have to be together, we have to be as one,
We share the ground beneath, we share the sun.
We have to be together, we have to be as one,
We share the ground beneath, we share the sun, sun, sun, sun,
We share the sun, sun, sun, sun,
We share the sun.
