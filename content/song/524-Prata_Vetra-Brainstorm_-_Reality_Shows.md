Am         G                     Dm
you can call me through the rain
Am                    G      Dm                   F
but if love is one sided it slowly turns into pain
Am         G                     Dm
you can call me through the snow
Am               G                    Dm                       F
it sounds too sweet, my dear, it sounds for me like a show
Em                     F
hey, the wind still blows
Em                           F     G
hey, too much reality shows

C                    F                Am                   G
but when we’re safe in glory, there’s no time for cries and sorries
C          F                  Am                   G
i will be there, no lying, though my singing bird is dying
Em                     F
hey, the wind still blows
Em                           F
hey, too much reality shows

Am    G                    Dm
they say red rose is a faith
Am  G  Dm                  F
i say – life’s too short to wait
Am    G                  Dm
what else can i say, i don’t know,
Am                                G             F                          G
but i know, but i know, but i know – our river of love stops to flow

C                    F                Am                   G
and when we’re safe in glory, there’s no time for cries and sorries
C          F                  Am                   G
i will be there, no lying, though my singing bird is dying
Em                     F
hey, the wind still blows
Em                           F
hey, too much reality shows
