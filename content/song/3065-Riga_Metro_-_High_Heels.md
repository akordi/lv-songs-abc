Dreaming about you since the day that we met
Waiting for you to call and hear you speak
This is nonsense, I really don’t know you
Oh boy, I really don’t know you

Dreaming about you since the day that we met
Waiting for you to call and hear you speak
This is nonsense, I really don’t know you
Oh boy, I really don’t know you

Dreaming about you since the day that we met
Waiting for you to call and hear you speak
This is nonsense, I really don’t know you
Oh boy, I really don’t know you

Dreaming about you since the day that we met
Waiting for you to call and hear you speak
This is nonsense, I really don’t know you
Oh boy, I really don’t know you

How ’bout I give you my heart, heart
Full of joy, full of hope, full of love, boy
Full of joy, full of hope, full of love, boy

How ’bout I give you my heart, heart
Full of joy, full of hope, full of love, boy
Full of joy, full of hope, full of love, boy

Red lips, bitchy look, high heels
Is this what will make his heart beat?
Red lips, bitchy look, high heels
Is this what will make his heart feel?

Red lips, bitchy look, high heels
Is this what will make his heart beat?
Red lips, bitchy look, high heels
Is this what will make him feel?

How ’bout I give you my heart, heart
Full of joy, full of hope, full of love, boy
Full of joy, full of hope, full of love, boy

How ’bout I give you my heart, heart
Full of joy, full of hope, full of love, boy
Full of joy, full of hope, full of love, boy

How ’bout I give you my heart, heart
Full of joy, full of hope, full of love, boy
Full of joy, full of hope, full of love, boy

How ’bout I give you my heart, heart
Full of joy, full of hope, full of love, boy
Full of joy, full of hope, full of love, boy
