```text
They told me better days will come 
So, I’ve been waiting patiently alone 
Thousands of sunsets on my own 
Locked up in my silent groan  
Where are you, my better days? 
It has been too long 
I remain tame for the years to come 
Until you bless me, my better days                      
How long will I whit-stand
My time is slipping through the fingers like sand 
How long will I whit-stand 
I guess so long, my better days! 
I’ll see you on the other side.
