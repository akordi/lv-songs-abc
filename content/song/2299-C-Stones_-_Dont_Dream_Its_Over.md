[C] There is freedom within, [Am] there is freedom without
[F] Try to catch the deluge in a paper [E] cup        
[C] There's a battle ahead, [Am] many battles are lost
[F] But you'll never see the end of the road
while you're [E] travelling with me

  [F] Hey now, [G] hey now 
  Don't [C] dream it's [Am] over
  [F] Hey now, [G] hey now 
  When the [C] world comes [Am] in
  [F] They come, [G] they come 
  [C] To build a wall [Am] between us
  [F] We know they won't win [G]

[C] Now I'm towing my car, [Am] there's a hole in the roof
[F] My possessions are causing me suspicion but [E] there's no proof
[C] In the paper today [Am] tales of war and of waste
[F] But you turn right over to the [E] T.V. page

  [F] Hey now, [G] hey now 
  Don't [C] dream it's [Am] over
  [F] Hey now, [G] hey now 
  When the [C] world comes [Am] in
  [F] They come, [G] they come 
  [C] To build a wall [Am] between us
  [F] We know they won't win [G]

[C] Now I'm walking again [Am] to the beat of a drum
[F] And I'm counting the steps to the door of your [E] heart
[C] Only the shadows ahead [Am] barely clearing the roof
[F] Get to know the feeling of liberation [E] and relief

  [F] Hey now, [G] hey now 
  Don't [C] dream it's [Am] over
  [F] Hey now, [G] hey now 
  When the [C] world comes [Am] in
  [F] They come, [G] they come 
  [C] To build a wall [Am] between us
  [F] We know they won't win [G]
