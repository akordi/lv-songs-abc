```text
don’t have to tell you how much
of the space you take in my heart
don’t have to prove too
you saw and felt from the very start
when you come over so frightened
like a little child
and tell me your story
to hear that I’m sorry
I’m always here for you

I’m gonna never tell you whatever
cose you are my special one
baby I’d better send you a letter 
just to say you are the one

my friends keep teasing me
man you are no more free
but they are happy to see
we are getting on so easy
every world evey phrase
that you come up with in one of those days
I try to absorb and set you free
of negative vibrations
you can see

laughing smiling cherring and more
means you are hot gona go out of my door
stay here with me
and you will see 
we are getting on so nice and easy
```
