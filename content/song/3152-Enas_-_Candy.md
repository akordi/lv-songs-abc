G
How can people speak about
F
Something they really don't know
G
They think it's so smart to tell
F
About problems they never had
G
But sometimes it's better to talk 
F
Than do nothing at all
G
So let's listen to each other
F
And turn these things to good

Piedz.:
G
You said your life is not 
F
So sweet as candy is
G F
And that's why you're drug addict
G F
Now it's good, but after some time
C F
My friend - your life will be
G
So painful like hell
 

G 
In your life are lots of days 
F
When you have to choose
G
And it's same point to live your life
F
With or without drugs
G 
So no one can make you do
F
Something you don't want to
G
You live your life only once
F
So it's in your hands

Piedz.

Em Am D

F G
And then you die! (x4)
