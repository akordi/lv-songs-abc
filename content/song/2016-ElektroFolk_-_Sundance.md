F  C
F               
Ride the sky, you sons of heaven  
Dance, you daughters of the sun
Ab           
Round and round across the heavens
Bb
Round and round around the sun

Light the fire in the heavens
Light the fire, ignite the sun
Singing in the air on seven
Beams of moonlight, braids of love 

G
Angels blow your horns of power
Golden world ring loud and clear
Bb 
Dawn will burn on heavenâ€™s tower
C
Hear the sound from far and near

Joining hands across the river
Trading rings they join the fun
Moonlight, shine around the circle
Lead the dance around the sun
