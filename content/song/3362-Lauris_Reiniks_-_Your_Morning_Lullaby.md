Goodbye, ciao or adios, you said and then I closed all the doors
And left all behind, with a hope I would find
My way back to you later, you said: “Our love will be greater
When I get to feel you again”, hope – it’s all we have

What I miss most of all is a little funny
It’s a song with no words, your morning lullaby
What I miss most of all is how I embraced you
When you sang into my ear your morning lullaby

But here, so far apart, daily it comes to my heart
That your song, your smile and your ciao
Were telling me: “Don’t leave now” (Don’t leave me now)

What I miss most of all is a little funny
It’s a song with no words, your morning lullaby
What I miss most of all is how I embraced you
When you sang into my ear your morning lullaby

Morning lullaby, oh…

What I miss most of all is a little funny
It’s a song with no words, your morning lullaby
What I miss most of all is how I embraced you
When you sang into my ear your morning lullaby
When you sang into my ear your morning lullaby
