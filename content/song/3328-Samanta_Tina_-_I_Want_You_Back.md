I want you back, I want to hold you in my arms
Don’t make me cry, come over here and let me be
Be your star again

I’m begging you, come over here and let me breathe
I’m begging you, come over here and let me breathe
Breathe, only you, only you

Sometimes I think that I’m in love but that isn’t true
Feeling so weird and shamed, what’s going on in my head?
Shame on myself cause I can’t get you out of my head

I want you back, I want to hold you in my arms
Don’t make me cry, come over here and let me be
Be your star again

Lonely night without, you are crushing my heart
Feeling so weird and shamed, what’s going on in my heart?
I thought that you are gone from my heart forever

I want you back, I want to hold you in my arms
Don’t make me cry, come over here and let me be
Be your star again

All this a lie, lie, lie
I’m still in love with you, can’t stop thinking about you
Please, please, forgive us
