I was a 
Broken tree in the middle of a storm
An old house that's about get torn down
No one could see me, everyone just passed by
Until the moment that you came in my life

I was a
Hollow shell, a reflection of myself
An empty cell on a rock somewhere (with no hope to spare)
No one could hear me everyone just passed by
Until the moment that you came in my life

And if the world should end tonight, 
I know I've got your hand in mine and have no fear (have no fear)
So put your faith in me and smile, 
I'm gonna build you up, never break you down. 
Just put your faith in me.

Can you hear me calling now?
Can you feel me reaching out?

I was a 
White lie in a pitch black room
A ray of light that can't be seen through the fumes
No one could feel me everyone just passed by
Until the moment that you came in my life

It was a strange kind of feeling, 
like when your heart hits the ceiling of your insides 
and you just can't hide anymore cause you know 
that this kind of thing don't happen to guys 
like you and me so you have to make the most of it

And if the world should end tonight, 
I know I've got your hand in mine and have no fear (have no fear)
So put your faith in me and smile, 
I'm gonna build you up, never break you down. 
Just put your faith in me.

Can you hear me calling now?
Can you feel me reaching out?
