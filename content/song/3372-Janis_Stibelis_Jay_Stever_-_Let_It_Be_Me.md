```text
Something happened to my mind
I just feel like I am blind
And you were always close to me

But I never saw you there
I was selfish, didn’t care
But right now I know I was wrong

Now I feel and I see
I will glow when you’re near

That’s why my love is so strong
Don’t take it wrong, let it be me
That’s why I already know
Deep in my soul, let it be me

This should be a happy song
But tonight I’m all alone
And I lost in this game for two

It’s so hard to find the words
I would rather find the notes
You will hear I’ll sing for you

And you’ll know how I feel
‘Cause this song is for you

That’s why my love is so strong
Don’t take it wrong, let it be me
That’s why I already know
Deep in my soul, let it be me

That’s why my love is so strong
Don’t take it wrong, let it be me
That’s why I already know
Deep in my soul, let it be me
Oh… oh… oh… let it be me
