```text
All of us have the same goal
To drive the road that makes us call man pleased
There’s an illusion we believe in
That our happiness can be taken away

Open up to what is now
Take a clear look at what’s going on
Is there a reason to smile
Or is it time to change for the better?

If you wanna see who can make you happy
Look in the mirror
If you wanna see who can make you happy
Look in the mirror

If you wanna see who can make you happy
Look in the mirror

I know I don’t have to wait long
Till I’ll be free from this need
To have something that gives me relief
I’m learning to love life as it is

Waiting for the perfect lover
Who will come and make my grief go away
But I know it’s too much to ask
I’ll just deal with my demons alone

If you wanna see who can make you happy
Look in the mirror
If you wanna see who can make you happy
Look in the mirror

If you wanna see who can make you happy
Look in the mirror

I know I don’t have to wait long
Till I’ll be free from this need
To have something that gives me relief
I’m learning to love

I know I don’t have to wait long
Till I’ll be free from this need
To have something that gives me relief
I’m learning to love life as it is

Ooh yeah yeah…
Till I’ll be free from this need

I’m learning to love, I’m learning to love
I know I don’t have to wait long
I’m learning to love (Life as it is)
