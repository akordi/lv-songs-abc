He came to fight hunger
World slowly walking
Keeping eye on you
Bite the tail
Overkill... take the lead
Run them free
And you know
Show some teeth
Playing hard
Hunt till dark

Wolves live for today
Their kill is fast
Keeping eyes on a prey
we will follow him at last .....gray wolf

Silent screams
Painful dreams
Bloody ground
Demon signs
Red skies victim's march
Keep the light in the eye
Let's begin this fight
And you know
Show some teeth
Playing hard
Hunt till dark

Wolves live for today,
Their kill is fast, keeping eyes on a prey,
We will follow him at last
Wolves live for today,
Their kill is fast, keeping eyes on a prey,
We will follow him at last .....gray wolf

Wolves live for today,
Their kill is fast, keeping eyes on a prey,
We will follow him at last
Wolves live for today,
Their kill is fast, keeping eyes on a prey,
We will follow him at last,
We will follow him at last .....gray wolf
