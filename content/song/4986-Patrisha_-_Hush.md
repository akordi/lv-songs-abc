Hey, I fly easy in the wind
Even with a heavy rain
I can elevate
Teardrops of pain
Rain on me, oh
Set me free from this bottomless pit
I wanna go
To my castle in blue print
It's waiting for me, mmm
If I make it seem like it's not easy
For me to show my soul
It's my way of saying to you
That I'm just a broken girl
Hush, hush
Baby, don't you cry
Promise you won't fall in love
Hush, hush
Baby, don't you cry
Promise you won't fall in love
Hush, hush
Baby, don't you cry
Promise you won't fall in love
Promise you won't fall in love
Hush, hush
Baby, don't you cry
Promise you won't fall in love
Promise there will be no bad blood
Mirror me
Let me into your sins
The devil wears Prada
I wear it like my skin
And all the chaos within
Meet me halfway
Tell me where to go
Change our sense of time
And let delusion grow
We're gliding slow
If I make it seem like it's not easy
For me to show my soul
Hush, hush
Baby, don't you cry
Promise you won't fall in love
Hush, hush
Baby, don't you cry
Promise you won't fall in love
Promise you won't fall in love
Hush, hush, hush
Hush, hush, hush
Hush, hush, hush
Hush, hush, hush
