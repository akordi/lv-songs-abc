```text
I`m ready to be
that one who`s next to me
I`m ready to be free
and treat your needs
when will you fall
I won`t burn
when will you call
I won`t turn

I have these friends
they don`t give all
they take it
and I starve

a sign in your face
tells the world I`m near
you`re smiling but it`s fake
and the sense and the fear

your minds are broken
with words unspoken
your minds are broken
my heart`s wide opened

right through your door
sun became low
you asked for more
I took it all
when will you fall
I won`t burn
when will you call
I won't turn
```
