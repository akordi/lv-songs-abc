Free your mind and stop the hesitation
There’s nothing else that we can do
Now it’s time for celebration
Of liberty and life we’ll bring to you

No matter if you’re black or white, no
No matter even weak or strong
Free your mind and your imagination
To make the choices of your own

It’s up to you, but I’ll be honest
We should realise somehow
Just be wise and don’t be nervous
Make your own decisions now

So come on, keep your heart wide open
Hot like oven, burning heart
First of all we believe in ourselves
Ready to go and ready to start

Ātri gāju, ātri skrēju
Ātru dzīvi dzīvodams

Free your mind and stop the hesitation
There’s nothing else that we can do
Now it’s time for celebration
Of liberty and life we’ll bring to you

No matter if you’re black or white, no
No matter even weak or strong
Free your mind and your imagination
To make the choices of your own

Ātri gāju, ātri skrēju
Ātru dzīvi dzīvodams
Ātri gāju, ātri skrēju
Ātru dzīvi dzīvodams

Your dreams will come true
It’s time to go through
For me and for you, oh…

Your dreams will come true
It’s time to go through
For me and for you
And for me and for you, hey

Free your mind and stop the hesitation
There’s nothing else that we can do
Now it’s time for celebration
Of liberty and life we’ll bring to you

No matter if you’re black or white, no
No matter even weak or strong
Free your mind and your imagination
To make the choices of your own

Ah…
Let’s stop the hesitation
There’s nothing else that we can do
Now it’s time for celebration
Of liberty and life we’ll bring to you
