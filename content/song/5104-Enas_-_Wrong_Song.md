#VERSE
Can you take me high?
Will you make my day in some other place?
Cruel and endless story
Time is up whenever you
Fade away and here it comes

#CHORUS
So what is wrong with you?
Can you tell me what is wrong with you
So what is wrong with you?
Can you tell me what is wrong with you

#VERSE
Show me how the dream to fill in those empty holes
The stars are falling down
It's a ray of light for glory
Break this wall before It could bring you down again (again)

#CHORUS
So what is wrong with you?
Can you tell me what is wrong with you
So what is wrong with you?
Can you tell me what is wrong with you

#BRIDGE
Don't frustrate me you still can make my day
Don't frustrate me you still can make my day
Don't frustrate me you still can make my day
Don't frustrate me you still can make my day

#PRE-CHORUS
Still can make my day
You still can make my day (hey)
Still can make my day
#instrumental

#PRE-CHORUS
What is wrong with you?
Can you tell me
What is wrong with you?
