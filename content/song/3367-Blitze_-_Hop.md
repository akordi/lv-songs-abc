You look like a girlfriend I’ve never had
You shine like a stars that never fall
You, you, it means me
You, you, it means never be free
　
Hop, hop, hop, jump over this edge
We’re not only friends where cool movie ends
And hop, hop, hop, just tell me whom else
Now should I suspect when in your heart
There’s no respect to me

Me, this is a guy who’ll never dance
You will never give to me this chance
Me, me, it means you
Me, me, it means never be free

Hop, hop, hop, jump over this edge
We’re not only friends where cool movie ends
And hop, hop, hop, just tell me whom else
Now should I suspect when in your heart there’s…

Hey baby, I’m not crazy
I’m just falling in love

Hop, hop, hop, jump over this edge
We’re not only friends where cool movie ends
And hop, hop, hop, just tell me whom else
Now should I suspect when in your heart there’s…

Hop, hop, hop, jump over this edge
We’re not only friends where cool movie ends
And hop, hop, hop, just tell me whom else
Now should I suspect when in your heart
There’s no respect to me
