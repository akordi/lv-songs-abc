It took a while 
but now you're mine
The neighbours said 
it's no suprise

Saturday's night
Changed my lif

I got a good looking girl
we're making love all night long
Yeah i got a good looking girl
la la la la la

Before that
i had a confrontation
And his loss
is my celebration

Saturday's Fight
Changed my life

Bridge

Chorus 2x
