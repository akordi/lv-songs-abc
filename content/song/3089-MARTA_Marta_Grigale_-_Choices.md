```text
Endless possibilities
Different you, different me
Lovers make and lovers break
Funny how the smallest thing can alter everything

Endless possibilities
Different you, different me
One step here and one step there
You are closer now and further than you’ve ever been

Every single choice you make
Every single step you take
The ink you leave’s indelible
Choices, choices

Every little word you say
Every promise that you break
The ink you leave’s indelible
Choices, choices

There’s always, there’s always
There’s always and always and always a choice
There’s always, there’s always
There’s always and always and always a choice

Endless possibilities
Different you, different me
You can stay or walk away
But you’ll never know for sure how it all would have been

Every single choice you make
Every single step you take
The ink you leave’s indelible
Choices, choices

There’s always (Choices)
There’s always a choice
There’s always, there’s always
There’s always and always a choice

There’s always, there’s always
There’s always and always and always a choice
There’s always, there’s always
There’s always and always and always a choice
