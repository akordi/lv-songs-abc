```text
The boy once told me it’s all up to you
Don’t listen to others, the best you can do
You’re always your own thing, just fight for your right
If someone’s to harm you just tell them goodnight

How eager to tell you that you are the star
Just know you are perfect and you will go far

Say my life is mine now
Say it’s my life to live
And if you want to touch me
That’s the best you can give to me

The spirit is tireless, your luck is alone
If ever you’re frightening just pick up the phone

How eager to tell you that you are the star
Just know you are perfect and you will go far

Say my life is mine now
Say it’s my life to live
And if you want to touch me
It’s the best you can give to me

Say my life is mine now
Say it’s my life to live
And if you want to touch me
It’s the best you can give to me (Give to me)
(Give to me)

Say my life is mine now
Say it’s my life to live
And if you want to touch me
It’s the best you can give to me
