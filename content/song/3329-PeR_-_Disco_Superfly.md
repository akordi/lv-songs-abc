Across all seas and nations
There’s a superfly kickin it wild
All the way from grandpa’s basement
He’s that old school kinda guy

Danger, funky feeling
Mister Superfly is in your town
Your lady’s psyched out, she’s screamin’
She can’t hold it to his stinky sound

You’re saying disco, disco, disco
Disco superfly
Disco, disco, disco
Disco superfly

Disco superfly
Disco superfly

Got no mother, got no lover
Superfly going undercover
Got no mother, got no lover
Superfly going undercover

He’s moving like a king, he’s amazing
Lights groovin’ with the vibe of the cool
Buzzing down, you know super crazy
Has the ability to rock your shoes

Disco, disco, disco
Disco superfly
Disco, disco, disco
Disco superfly

Disco superfly
Disco superfly
Disco superfly
Disco superfly

Got no mother, got no lover
Superfly going undercover
Got no mother, got no lover
Superfly going undercover

Disco superfly
Disco superfly
Disco superfly
Disco superfly
