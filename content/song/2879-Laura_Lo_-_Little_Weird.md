[C] Late night walking [Am] around in this old [F] city [G]
[C] Neon lights are [Am] flashing on your [F] perfect skin [G]
[C] You don’t even [Am] know that I’m watching your [F] every move [G]
Just [C] talking, walking, [Am] laughing, talking - [F] round and round [G]

Cause I’m [Am] feeling a little [F] weird [C] looking into [G] your eyes 
Cause I’m [Am] feeling a little [F] weird [C] looking into [G] your eyes 

  And we [Am] dance with no [F] music 
  And we [C] dream under [G] the stars 
  [Am] Dance with no [F] music 
  And we [C] dream under [G] the stars 

[C] Acting silly, feeling [Am] infinite 
You don’t [F] want to go home [G]
[C] We don’t mind what the [Am] others say
Cause we’re [F] having the best time [G] tonight 

And I’m [Am] feeling a little [F] weird [C] looking into [G] your eyes 
And I’m [Am] feeling a little [F] weird [C] looking into [G] your eyes 

  And we [Am] dance with no [F] music 
  And we [C] dream under [G] the stars 
  [Am] Dance with no [F] music 
  And we [C] dream under [G] the stars 

[Am] Floating somewhere in [F] the space 
[C] Floating somewhere in [G] the space 
[Am] Floating somewhere in [F] the space 
[C] Floating somewhere [G] 

  And we [Am] dance with no [F] music 
  And we [C] dream under [G] the stars 
  [Am] Dance with no [F] music 
  And we [C] dream under [G] the stars 

  [Am] Dance with no [F] music 
  And we [C] dream under [G] the stars 
  [Am] dance with no [F] music 
  And we [C] dream under [G] the stars
