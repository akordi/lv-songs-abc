```text
You call my name, but I was deaf and blind
I lost myself when I was deep in mind
No, I didn’t hear you cry, and I wonder why
Someone plays this dozy lullaby

You call my name, words scatter like the leaves
On empty streets they’ve gone and disappeared
No, I didn’t say you lied, but I wonder why
We can’t stop this endless lullaby

I am your old imaginary friend
I am your road going to the end
I am your dream, and time is always passing by
I am your last broken lullaby

You call my name, but there was just no sound
The doors are closed with no escape around
Oh, I wanted no reply, but I wonder why
Someone ever wrote this lullaby

I am your old imaginary friend
I am your road going to the end
I am your dream, and time is always passing by
I am your last broken lullaby

(I am your old imaginary friend
I am your road) going, going to the end
I am your dream, and time is always passing by
I am your last broken lullaby
