Verse 1:
Em                                         Am
  Sometimes in the morning it's so hard to choose
(It's so hard to choose 2x)

Em                                    Am
  Between drinking coffee or tying my shoes
(Or tying my shoes 2x)

Em                 D            Am    
  Sometimes in life you have to choose
             C
(You have to choose, you have to choose)

Em                 D               Am
  Between waking up or hitting the snooze
(Or hitting the snooze 2x)


Em   Am


Verse 2:

Em                             Am
  My momma says life's full of choises
(Life's full of choises)
Em                                                  Am
  And no matter what you do there's nothing you can lose
(There's nothing you can lose)


Pre-chorus and chorus:

(Silence)
But somehow I always know what to do and what to choose
'Cause there's nothing to lose
But somehow I always know what to do (Hey, hey)
                 
                Em   Am   
We know what to do       2x


Em   D   Am    C   2x

                Em     
We know what to do
We know what to do
                Am
We know what to do
We know what to do
                Em     
We know what to do
We know what to do
                Am
We know what to do
We know what to do
We know what to do


Verse 3:

Em                                         Am
  Sometimes in the morning it's so hard to choose
(It's so hard to choose 2x)

Em                                    Am
  Between drinking coffee or tying my shoes
(Or tying my shoes, ohh) 

Em                              Am    
  Sometimes in life you have to choose
(You have to choose 2x)

Em                                 Am
  Between waking up or hitting the snooze
(Or hitting the snooze 2x)


Pre-chorus and chorus:

(Silence)
But somehow I always know what to do and what to choose
'Cause there's nothing to lose
But somehow I always know what to do (Hey, hey)

                Em  
We know what to do
                D
We know what to do 
                Am
We know what to do 
We know what to do
                Em  
We know what to do
                D
We know what to do 
                Am
We know what to do 
We know what to do
We know what to do          


Em              D                   Am
  But somehow I always know what to do and what to choose
'Cause there's nothing to lose
Em              D                   Am
  But somehow I always know what to do (Hey, hey)
Em
Somehow
