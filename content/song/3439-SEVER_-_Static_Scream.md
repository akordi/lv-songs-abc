```text
Someday you'll come back home
Void since you've been gone
You've lit up a fire
But it's not enough to keep me warm
I'm just a shade of days we spent together
Dreaming of going back
And find the words to tell
That I am mute without your voice
And I can't stand waking up alone

I will keep the light on so you'll recognize our window
And make the horror end
I will keep the phone on hold 
Cause I hope to hear your voice through static scream

Our hands were locked so tight
But I couldn't keep you down
Cause you were made to live and die
Defying gravity
There's nothing here for me
Except this memory I must keep
So you can find your way back

I will keep the light on so you'll recognize our window
And make the horror end
I will keep the phone on hold 
Cause I hope to hear your voice through static scream

I do exist
As long as there is a remembrance
I can be a shade of
