Take my hand never let it go 
Promise me you'll always love so 
I will be the only one

But in the morning you told me so 
"I gotta go, my heart is way too cold 
Baby, can you let it, just go?"

All you do is just give up and fall in love with anyone who doesn't ignore you 
All I do is just get drunk and lose my heart to anyone who isn't controlling

Why do we even call it love? 
You lost attraction I lost my mind on you 
O, OH, NO 
Don't tell lies, speak truthfully 
You hang around only when your friends are out of town 
o, oh no

All you do is just give up and fall in love with anyone who doesn't ignore you 
All I do is just get drunk and lose my heart to anyone who isn't controlling

I'll be the one if you hold on to me darlin' 
I'll be the one, but there is something between darlin' 
I'll be the one if you hold on to me darlin' 
I'll be the one, but there is something between darlin'

All you do is just give up and fall in love with anyone who doesn't ignore you 
All I do is just get drunk and lose my heart to anyone who isn't controlling
