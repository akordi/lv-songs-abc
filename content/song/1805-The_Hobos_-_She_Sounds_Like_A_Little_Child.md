Intro
Am-G Em C Am G Em C Am
G Em C Am G Em C Am

F                                 Dm                      Am
Oh boy what happened I just can't tell you since you have left
     F                Dm                       Am
Many words said tears cried and some beautiful thefts
 F                       Dm                     Am
Promises whispered heads cut all the doors were shut
        F                                     Dm                   Am       E 
She was born in the park in the dark no pa no ma, singing la la la la la

    G             Em           C Am     G      Em C Am
She sounds like a little child   on the phone
    G             Em           C Am    G      Em C Am
She sounds like a little child   left alone

F                    Dm             Am
Single double triple cripple in the streets
F             Dm                       Am
Long haired strangers were looking for weed
 F          Dm           Am    E
Amazing so amazing being lazy

    G             Em           C Am     G      Em C Am
She sounds like a little child   on the phone
    G             Em           C Am    G      Em C Am
She sounds like a little child   left alone

F               Dm      Am
Take me take me take me take me
F               Dm    Am
Take me take me       take me
F       Dm        Am     E
Take me    to the stars

she sounds like a little child...
