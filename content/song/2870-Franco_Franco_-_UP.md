If I’m standing here for you
                   Am   Em
I’m standing all alone
                       F    F
And we’ve been here before
                          C   G
We’ve crashed into the ground


                      F   F
I didn’t catch your heart
                      Am  Em
You didn’t catch my soul
                       F  F
But I’m still missing you,
                      C    G
I remember what you said:
   
  Am/E G/D  C/E  F
  “Up, only up, only up...”
  Am/E G/D  C/E  F
  “Up, only up, only up...”
  Am/E G/D  C/E  F
  “Up, only up, only up...”
  Am/E G/D  C/E  F
  “Up, only up, only up...”

                      F   F
Oh, my disappearing love,
                  Am  Em
I want to let you go
                            F   F
But you’re carved into my heart
                   C   G
I will never be alone

              F   F
Maybe after years
                      Am  Em
Of searching what is love
               F   F
We will meet again
                C   G
To go the only way

  Am/E G/D  C/E  F
  “Up, only up, only up...”
  Am/E G/D  C/E  F
  “Up, only up, only up...”
  Am/E G/D  C/E  F
  “Up, only up, only up...”
  Am/E G/D  C/E  F
  “Up, only up, only up...”
