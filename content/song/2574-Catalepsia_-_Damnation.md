[Am] Look through my [F] mind 
It’s a [C] world of con[E]fusion 
[Am] There's nothing [F] right to see 
There’s [C] nothing true to [E] feel 

[Am] Run, I am [F] cursed 
Your [C] spell won’t [E] save me 
My [Am] world is dark and [F] bleak 
My [C] heart is still and [E] cold 

[Am] Speak to my [F] soul 
It’s a [C] voice of the non-[E] existent 
There’s [Am] nothing to [F] understand 
There’s [C] nothing fair for [E] you 

  [Am] I am too far, too [F] deep 
  You will [C] never reach my [E] soul 
  [Am] Stay away from [F] me 
  You [C] cannot make it [E] real 

  [Am] I’m too close to [F] fall 
  From the [C] heaven of your [E] dream 
  [Am] Say goodbye to me [F] dear 
  I’m [C] leaving you be[E]hind 

[Am] Look through your [F] mind 
It’s a [C] world of destruc[E]tion 
[Am] There’s nothing to [F] memorize 
There’s [C] nothing bright for [E] me 

[Am] Speak to your [F] soul 
It’s a [C] voice of fading [E] prayer 
[Am] There’s nothing [F] to revive 
There’s [C] nothing I can [E] change

  [Am] I am too far, too [F] deep 
  You will [C] never reach my [E] soul 
  [Am] Stay away from [F] me 
  You [C] cannot make it [E] real 

  [Am] I’m too close to [F] fall 
  From the [C] heaven of your [E] dream 
  [Am] Say goodbye to me [F] dear 
  I’m [C] leaving you be[E]hind
