I’m trying to clear the shades behind us
I search for way to own your trust
They’re coming up, they try to divine us
All of we got turn into dust

  Why can’t you share what you feel?
  What you’re feelin’?
  Why can’t you feel the love that i give
  Why can’t you share with me what you’re feelin’?
  What you’re feelin’?
  Why can’t you feel the love that i’m givin’?
  I know you need it tonight!
    I wanna give you love
    I wanna give you love
    ‘cause you need it tonight!

I’m lost in the mess made by the windstorm
Surrounded by pieces of dreams we had
I pick up the one’s we both have to live for
Trampling the others deep in the mud

  Why can’t you share what you feel?
  What you’re feelin’?
  Why can’t you feel the love that i’m givin’?
  I know you need it tonight!
    I wanna give you love
    I wanna give you love
    ‘cause you need it tonight!

Why can’t you feel?
My love

  Why can’t you share what you feel?
  What you’re feelin’?
  Why can’t you feel the love that i’m givin’?
  I know you need it tonight!
    I wanna give you love
    I wanna give you love
    ‘cause you need it tonight!
