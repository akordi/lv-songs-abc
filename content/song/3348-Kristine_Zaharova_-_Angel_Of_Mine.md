```text
Each time you leave me here alone
This is a time of getting caught
You take my soul away

Moments of truth that I can lose
Angel of mine who makes me shine
Please look

The door can hide
The sun when you close them
There’s no light in here

Anymore, the score
Whats the score when you close the door?
I feel like you’re beginning another war

This is a time of getting truth
Running away from me and you
You take my strength away

Moments of love that I can get
Angel of mine who makes me shine
Please look

The door can hide the sun
When you close them
There’s no light in here

Anymore, the score
What’s the score when you close the door?
I feel like you’re beginning another war

Another game
I feel like you’re beginning another war
