```text
Like the [G] wind’s turning round me
Like the [Em] leave’s falling on me
Like you [C] twisted before the leaving
Shut the [G] door

We’re like [G] one, but not together
We are [Em] looking for a better
So [C] conclusion is
We cannot live no [D] more

[Am] Easily, so [Em] easily
[C] Bring back sense you’ve felt so strong be[G]fore
[Am] Easily, very [Em] easily
[C] Put my soul into your heart and [D] go

My lover’s [G] gone
My lover’s [D] gone
I have [C] called your name to[D]night
My lover’s [Em] gone

My [G] prose…it feels so lonely
What I’ve [Em] wrote makes sense so slowly
Sometimes [C] worry someone
You don’t hear me [G] still

I just [G] need to make you worry
Don’t for[Em]get, I am so sorry
For all [C] troubles
That I’ve ever done be[D]fore

[Am] Easily, so [Em] easily
[C] Bring back sense you’ve felt so strong be[G]fore
[Am] Easily, very [Em] easily
[C] Put my soul into your heart and [D] go

My lover’s [G] gone
My lover’s [D] gone
I have [C] called your name to[D]night
My lover’s [Em] gone
