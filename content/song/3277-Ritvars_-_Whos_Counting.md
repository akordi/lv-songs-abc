```text
Time is slipping away
Through my fingers
My fingers are doing their best
To remember

What was it like running through your hair
Holding your hand
What was it like running through your hair
Holding your hand, holding you

Time is slipping away
Year after year
I wish there was a chance to work it out
Oh, I do

I’ve been away too long
I know that it’s wrong
It’s feels so wrong

I’ve been away too long
I know that it’s wrong
It’s feels so wrong

My son, I hope that some day
You’ll remember
What was it like when I held your tiny hand in mine
I do

What was it like running through your hair
Holding your hand, holding you
What was it like running through your hair
Holding your hand, holding you

What was it like running through your hair
Holding your hand, holding you
