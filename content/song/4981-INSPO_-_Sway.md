[Verse 1]
Far out from my kingdom
I can hear them say "You need one reason to sway"
Lean back, I will guide you through clear tracks
And make it [?] take a breath

[Pre-Chorus]
My lungs bound tight
Smoked out of life
And time


[Chorus]
Lost in space (Space)
Where memories in my heart
Drive case (Case)
And every word that I've said

[Verse 2]
Still attracts heavy floods
Down my hand
Dents, cracks and [?]
Trapped inside where it ends

[Pre-Chorus]
Falling into nothing

[Chorus]
Lost in space (Space)
Where memories in my heart
Drive case (Case)
And every word that you've said
Fights back
Energies from my past
Attacked

[Pre-Chorus]
Nearby in the kingdom
I can hear they say "You need one reason to let it sway"

[Chorus]
Lost in space (Space)
Where memories in my heart
Drive case (Case)
And every word that you've said
Fights back
Energies from my past
Attacked
