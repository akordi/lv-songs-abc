..sometimes I feel like a waterfall
..water runs still..
..the river goes up the hill, up the hill..

Sometimes I [C] feel like a [D] waterfall, like a [F] waterfall [F7] [Fm] 
Sometimes I [C] feel like a [D] waterfall, like a [F] waterfall [F7] [Fm] 

[C] Time stops for a while and water runs [Dsus2] still
[C] No more rush, the river goes up the [Dsus2] hill

Sometimes I [C] feel like a [D] waterfall, like a [F] waterfall [F7] [Fm] 
Sometimes I [C] feel like a [D] waterfall, like a [F] waterfall [F7] [Fm] 

[C] [D] 
[C] [D] [F] 

[C] Eternal flow, this miracle gives me [Dsus2] wings
[C] And no one can stop me, time's just playing my [Dsus2] strings

Sometimes I [C] feel like a [D] waterfall, like a [F] waterfall [F7] [Fm] 
Sometimes I [C] feel like a [D] waterfall, like a [F] waterfall [F7] [Fm] 

[C] [D] 
[C] [D] [F] 

[G] Little Space Gods kindly [C] watching [Am] through [F] cloudy, [F7] stormy [G] sky
[G] We are children of the [C] time [Am] machine
Who [F] always [F7] will ask [G] why
[Em] always will ask [Am] why
We [F] look [F7] up to the [G] sky
To fly [C]

repeat
[C] [D] 
[C] [D] [F]
