```text
[Em] I remember you were a [G] stranger once
In a [Am] grey world where [C] we belong [D]
[Em] You were standing right [G] next to me
In a [Am] different place with [C] many trees [D]

She [Am] changed my world with the [Em] blink of an eye
[G] That is something I [D] can't deny
[Am] Baby, [G] baby [D] 
We live in a grey [Em] world 

[Em] A little girl drew [G] hearts in the sand
On the [Am] beachside [C] hand in [D] hand
[Em] As fast as I can I [G] run from here
[Am] Anytime [C] of the [D] year

She [Am] changed my world with the [Em] blink of an eye
[G] That is something I [D] can't deny
[Am] Baby, [G] baby [D] 
We live in a grey world
She [Am] changed my world with the [Em] blink of an eye
[G] That is something I [D] can't deny
[Am] Baby, [G] baby [D] 
We live in a grey [Em] world
