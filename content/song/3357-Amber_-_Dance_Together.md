```text
The sun in the sky is so bright
When I look into your eyes,
But every day of my life
I think I’m running out of time.

So I wanna know your name,
And I’d love to see you around,
And I wanna make you feel
Like you never did before.

Let your body move to the music,
And let this stay forever,
Let your body move to the music
As long as we dance together.

The moon in the night was so right
When he told me to be smart,
To believe in the dreams of my life
And not to play with your heart.

So I wanna know your name,
And I’d love to see you around,
And I wanna make you feel
Like you never did before.

Let your body move to the music,
And let this stay forever,
Let your body move to the music
As long as we dance together.

I’ll never gonna loose what I have found (never gonna loose it),
Don’t wanna let this ever fade away,
And every day you can make me feel this way,
´cause everytime I feel the life within me,
I’ll never gonna loose it (I´ll never gonna loose it, loose it)
Until we dance (dance together).

Let your body move to the music,
And let this stay forever,
Let your body move to the music
As long as we dance together.

Let your body move to the music,
And let this stay forever,
Let your body move to the music
As long as we dance together.
