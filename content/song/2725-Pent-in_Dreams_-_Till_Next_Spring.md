Please don't make a walls around me
If You still wanna be a part of my life
We can't go on without rules between you and me!

But when we will find ourselves sleeping
In a daily routines water bed
It will be far away, far away from that spot

Where we was before those accidentally given
Butterfly's started to grow up
Your lips are standing still
I'm not reaching your thoughts!

Cause one of us trying to make our moonlight dancing
Into a one goal game without penalty shoots
And no breath taking rules

PDZ.
Bleeding hopes, daily routine, outspoken promises
We will fight, hand in hand till next spring
No breath taking rules and no walls around us

Each day she woke up with a hope
That this night will end with a different
With a different tone of voice when we are saying those 
words

Which are closing our eyes
Not forever, just till next sunrise
It seems like every conversation turning into a fight

But I don't wanna win this time
And it looks like she feel the same
So give me a hug and I swear I will hold you forever
This time I will keep that thought in my mind

PDZ.
Bleeding hopes, daily routine, outspoken promises
We will fight, hand in hand till next spring
No breath taking rules and no walls around us

Bleeding hopes, daily routine, outspoken promises
We will fight, hand in hand till next spring
