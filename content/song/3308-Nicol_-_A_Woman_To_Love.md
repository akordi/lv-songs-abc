You are the woman to love, woman to love
Oh oh oh yeah….
Woman to love, woman to love

Who cares about the past? Who knows about your future
When you’re falling in love with somebody?
Things are going fast, you try to do your best
Try not to think that he’s like your daddy

But something’s going wrong and then he’s moving on
He don’t need your help, your love, your attention
There’s nothing you can do, now it’s up to you
How not to lose your reason and be patient
Girl, don’t you think it’s gonna make you stronger?

Every day, every night
You better stop thinkin’ ’bout him, baby
Oh yeah, every day, every night
Your poor heart goes bum-bum-bum

‘Cause every time and tonight
You’re sitting here again alone at home
Let him know, let him show
That you’re the woman to love

Your friends wonder: “Why you crazy ’bout the guy
Who threw you love away, treats you badly?”
You truly hope and say: “My love will gonna find a way
The best and the rightest way to my baby”

The world is crashing down, your head is turning round
So you can’t eat or sleep or feel shady
But when he spells your name, you’re burning like a flame
It means that you’re still his lady
So, girl, would you take it any longer?

Every day, every night
You better stop thinkin’ ’bout him, baby
Oh yeah, every day, every night
Your poor heart goes bum-bum-bum

‘Cause every time and tonight
You’re sitting here again alone at home
Let him know, let him show
That you’re the woman to love

Every day, every night
You better stop thinkin’ ’bout him, baby
Oh yeah, every day, every night
Your poor heart goes bum-bum-bum

‘Cause every time and tonight
You’re sitting here again alone at home
Let him know, let him show
That you’re the woman

That you’re the woman
That you’re the, that you’re the woman to love
