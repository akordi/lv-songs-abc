```text
In a world that is beeping and blaring 
Growing louder every day
I cover my ears
But none of the noise will go away
Sirens, 
Barking dogs
Thank God for the one and only sound that turns it 
around and makes it right

  I hear your heart
  Whisprin’ to me
  No matter where I may happen to be
  Sending me love and shining it through
  I hear your heart
  Can you hear mine too?

Oh as sensitive people we’re trampled
Almost everywhere we go
There are days when we will die
If one more stranger tells us no
So I hope your shadows melt away  
As you say they’ve done before 
Just like the one and only sound that turns it around 
for me once more

  I hear your heart
  Whisprin’ to me
  No matter where I may happen to be
  Sending me love & shining it through
  I hear your heart
  Can you hear mine too?

A violin on a summer night
On a full moon mountaintop
Couldn’t sound as sweet as you do – don’t stop

  I hear your heart
  Whisprin’ to me
  No matter where I may happen to be
  Sending me love & shining it through
  I hear your heart
  Can you hear mine too?
