I am on my way
Setting sail to new directions
Ask me and I would stay
Your silence leaves
No room for questions

I flip the coin and let it choose
And either way it goes I will lose you

I can't see what life would be
If I had to live my life without you
Change of heart and I’m no part
Of your life who needs another start
Baby

I am standing tall
And graciously taking the fall
You I leave behind
Fear has made
Made you blind

So I flip the coin and let it choose
And either way it goes I will lose you

I can't see what life would be
If I had to live my life without you
Change of heart and I'm no part
Of your life who needs another start
Baby

I can’t see what life would be
If I had to live my life without you
I played the game it's all the same
If I had to live my life without you
Baby

(I can't see what life would be)
If I had to live my life without you
I played the game it's all the same
[?]
Oh yeah

I can't see what life would be
If I had to live my life without you
Oh yeah
If I had to live without you
If I had to live without you
