```text
and you come
then you go
but maybe there is something you don't know
and you go
then you come
but maybe there is something left undone

but maybe it's the wrong number
maybe it's another door
i should forget about every thing
go out and drink
get drunk and sing
born to be here
born to be drunk
like a psychedelic funk...

can you give me some now
can you give me some

and you rise
then you fall
but maybe there's something out of control
and you fall
then you rise
but maybe there is something wrong whith your eyes

but maybe it's the wrong number...
