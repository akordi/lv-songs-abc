```text
Seven thousand soldiers
But only one footprint on the ground

Take your time for orders
And cross the line before last call..

  Holders and keepers
  In all seven towers
  For hours and hours
  Till the end of the world

When all the doors are open
But there is no way to get in

Tell me if it is so easy
Why are we to blind to see..

Tell me if it so easy
Why are we to blind to see
Seven thousand soldiers
Seven thousand soldiers
```
