#VERSE
Seven thousand soldiers
But only one footprint on the ground

#VERSE
Take your time for orders
And cross the line before last call

#CHORUS
Holders and keepers
In all seven towers
For hours and hours
Till the end of the world

#CHORUS
Holders and keepers
In all seven towers
For hours and hours
Till the end of the world

#VERSE
When all the doors are open
But there is no way to get in

#VERSE
Tell me if it is so easy
Why are we to blind to see

#CHORUS
Holders and keepers
In all seven towers
For hours and hours
Till the end of the world

#CHORUS
Holders and keepers
In all seven towers
For hours and hours
Till the end of the world
#instrumental

#CHORUS
Holders and keepers
In all seven towers
For hours and hours
Till the end of the world

#CHORUS
Holders and keepers
In all seven towers
For hours and hours
Till the end of the world
#instrumental

#PRE-CHORUS
Tell me if it so easy
Why are we to blind to see
Seven thousand soldiers
Seven thousand soldiers
