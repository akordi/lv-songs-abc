```text
I used to be related to your world
But you close all the doors, so it’s starting to get cold
I could not get inside anymore
Because you wanted something more

I have a place for two, if you want it come back
My world will be waiting for you
I have a place for two, if you want it come back
My world will be waiting for you
And my world is waiting for you

I forgot that I got my own world
It is a place where I don’t pretend being someone else
You don’t understand the way I live my life
And I think you never, never really tried

I have a place for two, if you want it come back
My world will be waiting for you
I have a place for two, if you want it come back
My world will be waiting for you
And my world is still waiting for you

How fast we get used to the things that surround us (Surround us)
Even if you know that your soul (soul) is meant (meant) to be free (to be free)

(I have a place for two, if you want it come back)
(My world will be waiting for you) My world will be waiting for you
(I have a place for two, if you want it come back) Come, come, come back
(My world will be waiting for you)

(I have a place for two, if you want it come back) If you want it come back
(My world will be waiting for you) Oh yeah
(I have a place for two, if you want it come back) If you want it come back
(My world will be waiting for you)
And my world is still waiting for you
