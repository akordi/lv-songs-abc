A#/F        A#/F# A#/G A#/F# A#/F……..
Time flies away and we quickly forget
G                                         Hm
Autumn and spring, maybe favorite friends.
E                                                 G
Time flies away and we lose fragments of heart.

                       D                                    E
I don’t know who I am. You don’t know who you are.

                        G                                D

I don’t know who I am. We don’t know who we are.

          E

Who we are.

2. Time flies away, information so large.
    I change my style you can break many hearts.
    Time flies away and we lose fragments of life.

 G                          D            

Our life’s so fast like a river

     Am7                C
We fall and we rise to above
We know famous people and main creation
We live in such a dangerous world.

Sometimes we are so busy and tired
Sometimes we have nothing to say
I hope you remember, I hope you remind me
That we will be happy one day.
