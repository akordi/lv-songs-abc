```text
Wait, please look back at me again

You are standing by my side now
Waiting what I’ll say to you
Looking in my eyes so true
It never seemed so hard before

You, do you know a name of
Secret that hides history
Heart that finds a mystery?
Do you know how it has to be?

Wait, before you’ll be gone again
Wait, before you will go away
Wait, please look back at me again

Inside the night a star shines so bright that I see you
Into my mind where you tell a story of real truth
Your eyesight shows me the way through the darkest heights
To your mind where I can see the picture of mine

Wait, before you’ll be gone again
Wait, before you will go away
Wait, please look back at me again
Please look back at me

Wait, before you’ll be gone again
Wait, before you will go away
Wait, please look back at me again
Please look back at me

Wait, before you’ll be gone again
Wait, before you will go away
Wait, please look back at me again

Wait, please look back at me again
