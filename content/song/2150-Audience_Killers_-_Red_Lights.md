If my [D] car had feet in[G]stead of wheels
And [D] enormous shoes to pass the [G] highest hills
Then [D] I would cross the [G] road ignoring [D] red lights [G]
If my [D] plane had hands in[G]stead of wings
And a [D] seat belt safe to avoid [G] black rings
Then [D] I would con[G]trol air [D] traffic [G]

It [D] started [G] with your [D] magic
The [D] bold [G] lines of your [D] lipstick
[D] Any[G]way you like [D] it
Cause it [D] started [G] with your [D] magic
It [D] started [G] with your [D] magic
The [D] bold [G] lines of your [D] lipstick
[D] Any[G]way you like [D] it
Cause it [D] started [G] with your [D] magic

If my [D] car had feet in[G]stead of wheels
And [D] enormous shoes to pass the [G] highest hills
Then [D] I would cross the [G] road ignoring [D] red lights [G]
If my [D] plane had hands in[G]stead of wings
And a [D] seat belt safe to avoid [G] black rings
