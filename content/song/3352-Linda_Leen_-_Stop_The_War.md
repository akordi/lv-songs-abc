Let’s get ready enjoy little romantic pleasure of music and fun
Sweet like coconut water, Riga reggae style MC
And pretty lady Linda Leen
With maximum respect, effect in many aspects
That’s correct, move on

It was your heart that made me love you
It’s not your words like music sound
It was your body that made me feel so right
But are you goin’ out with me tonight?

It was your heart that made me love you
It’s not your words like music sound
It was your body that made me feel so right
But are you goin’ out with me tonight?

It’s hard to believe my love is attack
One step to front to one step to back
C’mon, mister officer, please, stop the war
Let’s make love and no kill any more

Take me, take me in your reggaeman world
I can show you my magic sweet word
1, 2, 3, let’s get horny with me
Move your body and dance little bit

It was your heart that made me love you
It’s not your words like music sound
It was your body that made me feel so right
But are you goin’ out with me tonight?

It was your heart that made me love you
It’s not your words like music sound
It was your body that made me feel so right
But are you goin’ out with me tonight?

One step to front, one step to back
It’s hard to believe my love is attack
Look at my body, have I move you, my sweet?
You can touch my body, ooh, little bit

Groovy sounds, jazzy dances
Take a look how DJ scratches
Too much of these tired faces
And “who’s better” races

Take this mask off your face
And see your smile saying everything’s fine
And I’ll say we’ll party till the war is over

It was your heart that made me love you
It’s not your words like music sound
It was your body that made me feel so right
But are you goin’ out with me tonight?

It was your heart that made me love you (Take my body)
It’s not your words like music sound (I use like machine)
It was your body that made me feel so right (I give you protection)
But are you goin’ out with me tonight? (Complete me, my sweet)

It was your heart that made me love you (Stop the war)
It’s not your words like music sound (Take off your dress)
It was your body that made me feel so right
But are you goin’ out with me tonight?
