I don’t remember
A lot of things
But the one thing I remember
Is the last night of December
 
I didn’t notice
You were around
How can I be so lifted
At the same time feel so twisted?
 
Oooh!
I’m not fluent
But the language of our love
Takes me higher and above
 
Oooh!
How do you do it?
‘Cos the language of our love
Takes me higher and above
 
Oooh! (oooh! oooh!)
There was a fire (fire, fire)
After drinking cherry absinthe
We felt we needed something (x2)
 
More of it (more of it, more of it, more of it)
 
I was struggling
To find my words
There’s so much I want to tell you
But the words can never come through
 
It didn’t matter
Because I knew
You see, whatever I would ask her
Her eyes had all the answers
 
Oooh!
I’m not fluent
But the language of our love
Takes me higher and above
 
Oooh!
How do you do it?
‘Cos the language of our love
Takes me higher and above
 
Oooh! (oooh! oooh!)
There was a fire (fire, fire)
After drinking cherry absinthe
We felt we needed something (x2)
 
I can feel the heat
When you look at me
If you know
What I mean (x6)
I can feel the heat
I can feel the…
 
Oooh! (oooh! oooh!)
There was a fire (fire, fire)
After drinking cherry absinthe
We felt we needed something (x2)
 
Oooh! (oooh! oooh!)
There was a fire (fire, fire) (x2)
 
Oooh! (oooh! oooh!)
There was a fire (fire, fire)
After drinking cherry absinthe (cherry absinthe, cherry absinthe, cherry absinthe, cherry absinthe…)
