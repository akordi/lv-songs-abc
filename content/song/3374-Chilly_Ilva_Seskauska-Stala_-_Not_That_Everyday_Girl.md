I say maybe I’d like to be a movie star
I say maybe I’d like to have a lot of toys
I say maybe I’m not that everyday girl
(Everyday girl) You used to know, oh oh
I say maybe I’m a little bit crazy

I’ve got a lot of things, good things
(She’s got a lot of things)
Bad things, real things
(She’s got a lot of things)

And maybe I want to show you them all
To let you enjoy my world
To enjoy my world

I say maybe I really don’t care what my father says
I say maybe I really don ‘t care what the newspapers write about me
I say maybe I’m not that everyday girl
(Everyday girl) You used to know, oh oh
I say maybe I’m a little bit crazy

I’ve got a lot of things, good things
(She’s got a lot of things)
Bad things, real things
(She’s got a lot of things)

And maybe I want to show you them all
To let you enjoy my world

I’ve got a lot of things, good things
(She’s got a lot of things)
Bad things, real things
(She’s got a lot of things)

And maybe I want to show you them all
To let you enjoy my world

(She’s got a lot of things, good things)
Oh, I’ve got a lot of things
(Bad things, real things)

Mmm, such good, such bad, such good, such bad
(And maybe she wants to show you them all)
I’ve got a lot of things
(To let you enjoy my world)

(She’s got a lot of things, good things)
Mmm, I’ve got a lot of things
(Bad things, real things)

Some good, some bad
(And maybe she wants to show you them all)
To let you enjoy my world
Mmm, to let you enjoy my world
To let you enjoy my world
