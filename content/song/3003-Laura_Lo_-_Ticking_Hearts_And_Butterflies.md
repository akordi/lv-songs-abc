[C] Staring at [Em] you
[Am] Making my [Em] choice – it’s [C] you [Em][Am]
It’s [Em] always been you
[C] Pretty nervous [Em] conversation
[Am] Everybody [Em] notice but [C] you [Em][Am]
Staring [Em] back at me

  It’s [F] magical 
  It’s [C] beautiful 
  It’s [Em] you and me
  It is [Am] love, love, love
  [F] Magical
  [C] Beautiful [Em][Am]

[C] Ticking hearts and [Em] butterflies
You [Am] color my world
It [Em] is for real
But [C] seems like dream
And [Em] all the time
We [Am] cross each other [C] mind

  It’s [F] magical 
  It’s [C] beautiful 
  It’s [Em] you and me
  It is [Am] love, love, love
  [F] Magical
  [C] Beautiful [Em][Am]
