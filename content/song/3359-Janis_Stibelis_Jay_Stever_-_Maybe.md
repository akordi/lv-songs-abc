Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, oohoo

I tried to be the, the one who knows what life is all about
To explain existence, to find the goals and reasons for my life
But I’m only human and I lost my answers
When suddenly you came into my life

Maybe finally I’ve got somebody
Maybe truly you are like nobody
Maybe finally I feel it
And I don’t have my answers with your love

Doo, doo, doo, doo
Say doo, doo, doo, doo, oohoo

I try to find my, my whereabouts in this world if only I could see
My whereabouts I’m near beside you, it doesn’t matter where it could be
Like I’ve got the answers I still have a question
And the question is still:

Maybe (maybe) finally I’ve got somebody
Maybe truly you are like nobody
Maybe finally I feel it
And I need you (and I don’t have my answers with your love)

When time will pass us by I still see you side by side
Because of time doesn’t matter
By the air that I breathe, you are so real
But sometimes I keep asking myself:

Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, oohoo

Maybe finally I’ve got somebody
Maybe truly you are like nobody
Maybe finally I feel it
And I don’t have my answers with your love, with your love

Maybe finally I’ve got somebody
Maybe truly you are like nobody
Maybe finally I feel it
And I don’t have my answers with your love
