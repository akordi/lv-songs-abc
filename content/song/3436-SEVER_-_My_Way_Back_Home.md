```text
I'm so sorry
You were the only wisdom that I've ever known
But you followed
The flames into the night sky
And the fault is my own

I've walked into the hands of shadow
It's haunting me
I've heard you screaming my name

So far behind your eyes
I could not see
So deep inside your words
I could not feel

I see the grass beneath my feet
Why am I still here?
Why am I still dead?
I can't exist between two worlds

I just want to be saved
The saints won’t call my name
But you’re the only one who could

So far behind your eyes
I could not see
The way it could comfort me
A tiny spark that turned to flames in my hands

So deep inside your words
I could not feel
A little wish that destroyed our lives
The moment I took it away

How long will I wonder
This land I was promised?
How long will I follow you?

You’ve tried to break through
You wanted me to understand
That road of thousand miles
With rivers and stars
There to guide
Lies across your heart

I was so long gone
To find my way back home
To share the dream that I stole
With the one I’ve lost

So deep inside your words
I could not feel
A little wish that destroyed our lives
The moment I took it away
