Silence
When our words will turn to silence
We’ll find the beat of love
We’ll hear the beat of love

Diamonds
Will light up the skies and find us
What we rushed to lose too fast
Thinking that it would just last

Lions
In our hearts we’ll find our lions
They’ll never let us fall
They’ll guard the light that brings us home

Through the night, through the time
We’ll stand hand in hand, we’ll fight side by side
Through the night, like the lions that we are

Sunrise
We have dreamed a dream of sunrise
When the morning finally comes
We’ll hear the call of love

Silence
When our words will turn to silence
We’ll find the call of love
We’ll hear the call of love

Lions
Come and gather all my lions

Through the night, through the time
We’ll stand hand in hand, we’ll fight side by side
Through the night, through the time
We’ll stand hand in hand, we’ll fight side by side
Through the night, like the lions that we are

(Through the night, time by time)
