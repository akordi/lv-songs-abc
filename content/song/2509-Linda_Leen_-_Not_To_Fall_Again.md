[C] No, it's not your business
How I feel, what truth is
All I want is [Dm] peaceful life without you
[C] Can't stand loneliness, but I hate crowd too
[F] Can't live with you, but I [E] can't live without you...

  [Am] Oh, God, please help me [Dm] not to fall again
  [E] I'm gonna take it no [Am] more
  [A7] All that has [Dm] left from us now
  Is [C] just [F] tears I [E] cry

[C] No, it's not your business
How I feel, what truth is
All I want is [Dm] peaceful life without you
[C] Can't stand loneliness, but I hate crowd too
[F] `Cause I'm afraid to [E] see your face there...

  [Am] Oh, God, please help me [Dm] not to fall again
  [E] I'm gonna take it no [Am] more
  [A7] All that has [Dm] left from us now
  [C] Is just [F] memo[E]ries

[A] My love is killing me,
But [G] I won't give up
[A] There's been too much hurt & pain
To [G] let you stay now
[A] We're holding to past,
But I [G] still don't know
Could I [F] love you more
Than I [G] do right [A] now ...

  [Dm] Oh, God, please help me [G] not to fall again
  [A7] I'm gonna take it no [Dm] more
  [D7] All that has [G] left from us now
  Is [F#] just [B] tears I [A] cry
