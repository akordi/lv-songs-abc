[1. VERSE]
Hello my name is Mr. Evil
Don't you wanna play my game?
Don't you wanna play my game?
Hello i'm not so painful
As they want me to be (as they want me to be)

[1. Chorus]
I'm not so bad I'm sad, but my name's Mr. Evil (Evil)?
I can love you through my pain, but you are so grateful
I can love you through my pain, but you are so grateful
And I think too grateful for me (for me, for me)
[1. Instrumental]

[2. VERSE]
Goodbye bye (bye) there's nothing to say more
About these times nowadays about these times and our days
Goodbye bye (bye) we'll be able to gather
Like a moon and a sun (like a moon and the sun)

[2. Chorus]
I'm not so bad and said by names, Mr. Evil (Evil)?
I can love you through my pain, but you are so grateful
I can love you through my pain, but you are so grateful
And I think too grateful for me (for me, for me, for me)
[2. Instrumental]

[1. BRIDGE]
Love was no time ago It pains every day and everywhere
Love was no time ago It pains every day and everywhere
Love was no time ago It pains every day and everywhere
Love was no time ago a pain is every day and every day and every way

[3. Chorus]
Ah, I'm not so bad and sad about names, Mr. Evil (Evil)?
I can love you through my pain, but you are so grateful
I can love you through my pain, but you are so grateful
And I think too grateful for me

[4. Chorus]
I'm not so bad I'm sad, but my name's Mr. Evil (Evil)?
I can love you through my pain, but you are so grateful
I can love you through my pain, but you are so grateful
And I think too grateful for me (for me, for me)
