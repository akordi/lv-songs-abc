We live for love
We were born to be as one
We live for love
And together we belong

We live for love
We were born to be as one
We live for love
And together we belong

I’d cross the Nile, the shallow moon
I’d span the ocean through
I’d do it all each chance I get
For you

Warm blood, warm blood runs through in you and me, yeah
Warm blood, warm blood to our hearts beats through, yeah

We live for love
We were born to be as one
We live for love
And together we belong

Do you feel me? Run away with love
I’m getting closer to you
The fireworks, a million years
For us

Warm blood, warm blood runs through in you and me, yeah
Warm blood, warm blood to our hearts beats through, yeah

(Chance, nature, compulsion, heartbeat)
(Reason, passion, desire)

We live for love
We were born to be as one
We live for love
And together we belong

We live for love
We were born to be as one
We live for love
And together we belong
