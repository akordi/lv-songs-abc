When I was young boy my mama said
“What goes around comes around”
I didn’t listen but now I see she was right

Years go by faster than we may thought
Time heals it all except one thing
This is that moment, don’t let it sink, don’t let it sink

When I close my eyes I see the world inside
There’s no pain, there are no lies with closed eyes
When I close my eyes I see the world inside
There’s no pain, there are no lies with closed eyes

When I was young boy my mama said
What goes around comes around
This is that moment, don’t let it sink, don’t let it sink
