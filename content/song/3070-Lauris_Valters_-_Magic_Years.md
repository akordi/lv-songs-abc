When this world is turning and the fire is burning
I keep thinking about you, every moment, my love
Can we feel much stronger and make it last longer?
Flow down in this river while light is coming from above

See children growing, I should be glad
Is this the best we ever had?

I’m looking for signs in the wind
I’m looking for signs in the water
I’m looking for signs on the ground
I’m looking for signs in the fire

When this world is turning and the fire is burning
I keep thinking about you, every moment, my love
Can we feel much stronger and make it last longer?
Flow down in this river while light is coming from above

See children growing, I should be glad
Is this the best we ever had?

I’m looking for the signs in the wind
I’m looking for the signs in the water
I’m looking for the signs on the ground
I’m looking for the signs in the fire

I’m looking for the signs in the wind
I’m looking for the signs in the water
I’m looking for the signs on the ground
I’m looking for the signs in the fire

I’m looking for the signs in the wind
I’m looking for the signs in the water
I’m looking for the signs on the ground
I’m looking for the signs in the fire

When I hear that laughter
It’s the greatest music to my ears
I hope you’ll be next to me
Through all those magic years

From above my love, from above my love
Through all those magic years
From above my love, from above my love
Through all those magic years

From above my love, from above my love
Through all those magic years
From above my love, from above my love
Through all those magic years
