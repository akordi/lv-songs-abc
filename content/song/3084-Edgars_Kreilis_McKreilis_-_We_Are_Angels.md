```text
You got my eyes opened
Before my heart was broken, frozen still
It’s not my life, she said
“Wake up your mind before we separate”

But no more
I will look at you same way
And no more
I will see you again, no no

What if we’ve been telling lies to ourselves
About who we are?
If we are more that we are now
Let me guess

We are the only angels left
We are the only angels left

Doors unlocked, we’re inside, standing still
How unseen colours look like?
They must be perfect but I’ve got separated

From you too
Will I look at you last time?
And no more
I will see you again

We are the only angels left
We are the only angels left
We are the only angels

Falling late in the night
Thousand feet in the sky
One by one away we fly
Let them see

We are the only angels left
We are the only angels left
We are the only angels left
(Oh, we are, all our lives)
We are the only angels
