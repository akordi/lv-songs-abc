```text
You are setting fires in my name.
You invite a moth into the flames.
There’s a steep price to pay,
But I know that I’ll stay.

  Your kind of sorcery is dangerous to me —
  It’s gonna blow us skyscraper high.
  Your sensuality is stirring something deep,
  Unless it’s all a trick of the night.

  My heart is made of dynamite, dynamite!
  Dynamite, dynamite! Dynamite, dynamite!

I should tell myself until I learn.
Oh, try and get away before you burn.
There’s a steep price to pay.
But I know that I’ll stay.

  Your kind of sorcery is dangerous to me.
  It’s gonna blow us skyscraper high.
  Your sensuality is stirring something deep.
  Unless it’s all a trick of the night.

  My heart is made of dynamite, dynamite!
  Dynamite, dynamite! Dynamite, dynamite!
  My heart is made of dynamite, dynamite!
  Dynamite, dynamite! Dynamite, dynamite!

And when you come around the sound is deafening.
It doesn’t beat so much as it pounds for you.

The risk I’m gonna die to take…

  Dynamite, dynamite! Dynamite, dynamite!
  Dynamite, dynamite! Oh!
  Dynamite, dynamite! Dynamite, dynamite!
  Dynamite, dynamite! Oh!
