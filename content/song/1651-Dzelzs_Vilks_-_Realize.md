G
Take time to realize

D                    C        Em     D
That your warmth is crashing down on me


G
Take time to Realize

D                       C        Em         D
That I am on your side  Didn’t I,  didn’t I tell you

C          Em
But I cant spell it out for you

D
No its never gonna be that simple

C         Em                D
No I cant spell it out for you


            G                    D
If you just realize, what I just realized

              Em                              C
Then we’d be perfect for each other and we’ll never find another

G                   D
Realize what I just realized, 

      Em                        C
You never have to wonder if we missed out on each other girl



G
Take time to realize

D                    C        Em     D
That I'm on your side Didn't I, didn't I tell you

G
Take time to realize

D                          C         Em         D
This all can pass you by.. Didn't I ,  didn’t I tell you



C          Em
But I cant spell it out for you

D
No its never gonna be that simple

C         Em                D
No I cant spell it out for you


            G                    D
If you just realize, what I just realized

              Em                              C
Then we’d be perfect for each other and we’ll never find another

G                   D
Realize what I just realized, 

      Em                        C
You never have to wonder if we missed out on each other girl



Em          D     C                D
Its not the same, no its never the same

   Em/D/G/G/C/
If you don’t feel it too

Em             D         C                    D
If you meet me half way, If you would meet me half way

   Em/D/G/G/C/
If you don’t feel it too

Em             D         C                    D
If you meet me half way, If you would meet me half way

   Em/D/G/G/C/
It could be the same for you...


            G                    D
If you just realize, what I just realized

              Em                              C                 G
Then we’d be perfect for each other and we’ll never find another
