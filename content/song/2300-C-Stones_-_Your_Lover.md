[Am] Lately you ain't payin' [F] attention
[G] Goes un-noticed that she feels too un[Am]loved too much
[Am] Been holding back on your [F] affection
And she's [G] not the kind who'll be inclined to [Am] hold out for your touch

[Am] You need to treat her [F] tender
Or she'll [G] go somewhere else to ger the [Am] lovin' that she needs
[Am] You better treat her [F] better
Or gone is [G] what you're gonna find she's [E] gonna be

  Your [Am] lover just might find another [F] lover
  Just might be you might [G] discover
  Someone might take your [E] place, might take your place, oh
  Your [Am] good thing sure ain't gonna be a [F] sure thing
  If you don't give her what her [G] heart needs
  You're gonna be [E] replaced, you'll be replaced, oh
  Your [F] lover [G] 
  [Am] just might find [E] another [Am] lover

[Am] Always seem to be [F] forgetting
To say [G] words you need to say, words she [Am] needs to hear
[Am] There'll be a day you'll be re[F]gretting that you [G] let her go
When you're alone just [Am] wishing she was near

[Am] You'll wish that you had [F] told her
Oh all [G] those things you never thought important [Am] to express
[Am] You need to hold her [F] closer
Or you [G] might lose what you might never [E] find again

  Your [Am] lover just might find another [F] lover
  Just might be you might [G] discover
  Someone might take your [E] place, might take your place, oh
  Your [Am] good thing sure ain't gonna be a [F] sure thing
  If you don't give her what her [G] heart needs
  You're gonna be [E] replaced, you'll be replaced, oh
  Your [F] lover [G] 
  [Am] just might find [E] another [Am] lover
