```text
If you could be mine
We could fly away
Not only for a while
But until the rest of our days

I tried to walk away
But every time I see you
I don’t know what to say
And how to change my ways

We wake up with a smile
We don’t need anything new
Cause there is just one thing
That we want to do

You want to be mine
And I need to fly away
And nobody could make us
Here tonight to stay

Day and night we are running away
Runaway to be happy
Day and night
Day and night we are running away
Runaway to be happy
Day and night

If you could be mine
We could fly away
Not only for a while
But until the rest of our days

I tried to walk away
But every time I see you
I don’t know what to say
And how to change my ways

And so the time goes by
And nothings left to feel
And nothings all around us
Feels that real so

Day and night we are running away
Runaway to be happy
Day and night
Day and night we are running away
Runaway to be happy
Day and night
