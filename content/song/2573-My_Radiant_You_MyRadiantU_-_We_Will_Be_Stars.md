[Am] She was just a [F] girl, she wanted to [C] fly [G] away
[Am] Love gave the [F] wings made out of [C] tears, and [G] SHAME

Love is a [Am] miracle, [F]  it's a [C] miracle maker [G]
She needed a [Am] miracle, [F] [C] something that could take her [G]

  Into the [F] stars
  Tonight in the [C] sky
  No one would [G] take away her [Am] pride
  She won't be [F] silent, silent [C] 
  She won't be [Am] silent, silent [G]

[Am] He was just a [F] boy, he wanted to [C] change his [G] star
[Am] Love gave him the [F] wings, he can [C] go high and [G] far

Love is a [Am] miracle, [F]  it's a [C] miracle maker [G]
We needed a [Am] miracle, [F] [C] something that could take [G] us

  Into the [F] stars
  Tonight in the [C] sky
  No one would [G] take away our [Am] pride
  We won't be [F] silent, silent [C]
  We won't be [Am] silent, silent [G]

  We will be [F] stars tonight in the [C] sky
  No one will [G] take away our [Am] pride
  We won't be [F] silent, silent [C]
  We won't be [Am] silent, silent [G]

  We will be [F] stars tonight in the [C] sky
  No one will [G] take away our [Am] pride
  We won't be [F] silent, silent [C]
  We won't be [Am] silent, silent [G]

Above the [F] skyline [C]
[G] Into the open [Am] space
I see [F] oblivion [C]
[G] Signing the light [Am] rave

  We will be [F] stars tonight in the [C] sky
  No one will [G] take away our [Am] pride
  We won't be [F] silent, silent [C]
  We won't be [Am] silent, silent [G]

  We will be [F] stars tonight in the [C] sky
  No one will [G] take away our [Am] pride
  We won't be [F] silent, silent [C]
  We won't be [Am] silent, silent [G]
