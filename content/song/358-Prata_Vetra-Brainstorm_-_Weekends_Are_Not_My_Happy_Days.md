I`m grateful to see
Am G
that you were listening to me
C F
Weekends come and go away
Am G
Weekends are not my happy days
C F
But who is to blame
Am G
My days and me - they are the same

I`m looking for words at the top of the mountain,
to tell you my friend that we reached the end
Things are so different - a little insane,
they will be us and maybe the sad rain

I`m grateful to see
that you were cheating me
Say something - take a chance
I`m talking but words they make no sense
But who is to blame
My days and me - they are the same

I`m looking for words at the top of the mountain,
to tell you my friend that we reached the end
Things are so different - a little insane,
they will be us and maybe the sad rain

The sky will be our movie,
popcorn is no longer fun,
coke we`ll drink at home
We`re going to watch the setting sun

I`m looking for words at the top of the mountain,
to tell you my friend that we reached the end
Things are so different - a little insane,
they will be us and maybe the sad rain
