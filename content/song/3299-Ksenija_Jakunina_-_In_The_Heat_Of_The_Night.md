Shame on you, you’re a naughty boy
I should be home by now
It’s so true, love is such a joy
Everything is perfect, a bottle of champagne in a park
In a bed of flowers, romancing in the dark

In the heat of the night
Making sweet love under the sky
In the heat of the night
All alone my lover and I
In the heat of the night

Bless my soul, what is wrong with me?
I just can’t get enough
I’m ready if you’re willing
I’m feeling in my heart this is the night
It’s in the way you thrill me
I know the time is right

In the heat of the night
Making sweet love under the sky
In the heat of the night
All alone my lover and I
In the heat of the night, night, night

When we’re together, I don’t know whether
I should laugh or cry
I can’t live without you, everything ’bout you
Makes me feel alive

In the heat of the night
Making sweet love under the sky
In the heat of the night
All alone my lover and I

In the heat of the night
Making sweet love under the sky
In the heat of the night
All alone my lover and I
In the heat of the night
