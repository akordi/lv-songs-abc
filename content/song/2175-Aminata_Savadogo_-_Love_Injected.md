[Em] You bring [G] the light [C] to my darkest [Am] side, babe
[Em] The day, [G] the night [C] split to cure the [Am] sight, ooh
[Em] You care, [G] you animate
[C] You guard me bare, [Am] bring up the heart rate

  Your [Em] love revives my [C] soul
  And I [G] know you’ll choose it whole over[C]all [Am]

[Em] Your eye’s a good mirror, [G] look under the cover
[C] Love is above [Am] all
[Em] I’m safe into your hands
[G] Let’s move away, [C] the edges ex[Am]pand

  Your [Em] love revives my [C] soul
  And I [G] know you’ll choose it whole over[C]all [Am]

Show me the [Em] source of the light, I’m becoming [C] affected
Seeing the [Em] glow of the white is what I have de[C]tected
Feeling [Em] again I’m alive, it’s your shining re[C]flected
Love in[Em]jected, love in[C]jected

  Your [Em] love revives my [C] soul
  And I [G] know you’ll choose it whole over[C]all [Am]
  Your [Em] love revives my [C] soul
  And I [G] know you’ll choose it whole over[C]all [Am]

[Em][G][C][Am]

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh. oh, oh
