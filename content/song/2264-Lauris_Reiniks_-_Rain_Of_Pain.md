[Am] Can’t [G] water salt [D] out of my [F] eyes
[Am] Can’t [G] live no more with [D] my rain of [F] pain
It’s [Am] mine and [G] nobody [D] knows it
And no one should Coz it [F] loves me killing me slowly
And I hate [E] it

[Am] An[G]other day [D] has come [F]
[Am] I wake up [G] and I know they [D] want me to [F] smile
[Am] And so I do and [G] so I do
[D] For a little [F] while
And they love my act
That’s a [E] fact

  When [Am] I get back [D] home
  I [G] put my smile [E] away
  Don’t [Am] need it no [D] more
  [G] Again it’s [E] me
  [F] Waiting for [G] something [Am] desperately
  [F] Waiting for [G] something [Am] desperately

I wish I could find the way
To make myself enjoy this day
But I can’t, but I can’t
Only if they want me to I’ll pretend
But will I stand? –

  When [Am] I get back [D] home
  I [G] put my smile [E] away
  Don’t [Am] need it no [D] more
  [G] Again it’s [E] me
  [F] Waiting for [G] something [Am] desperately
  [F] Waiting for [G] something [Am] desperately

  When [Am] I get back [D] home
  I [G] put my smile [E] away
  Don’t [Am] need it no [D] more
  [G] Again it’s [E] me
  [F] Waiting for [G] something [Am] desperately
  [F] Waiting for [G] something [Am] desperately
