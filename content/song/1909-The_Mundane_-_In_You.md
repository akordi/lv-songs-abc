Am      G
I am in you
Am           G
now I can be true
Am              G
you cheer up my life
                  Am 
with every little smile
                  G
what comes like a bloom 

          B            C
Would you be a part of me
                  D         G
and comprehend my fears within
          B               C
would you cease my aching peace
                   D
or you will simply leave

  G              Em    
Today I start my life for good
    C
And hoist the flag in color blue
G        Em       C
To be in to be in you

Am           G
Now I can be blind
Am                G
'cause you are my guide
Am                      G
there's nothing more to lose
                          Am
there's something more to chose
      G
in my life
