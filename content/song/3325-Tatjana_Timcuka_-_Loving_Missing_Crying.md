Don’t look back, no more to say
I will stay you’ll go away
No more lies, no words to say
Fly away…

No more fear into my eyes
Just go on you know the price
No more lies, no words to say
Fly away…

Loving, missing, crying,
Go on I will find you
Screaming, loosing, waiting
I’m staying beside you
Loving, missing, crying,
All I want is to be
I’m running, but I’m falling
I’m standing and keep going.

Loving, missing, crying,
Go on I will find you
Screaming, loosing, waiting
I’m staying beside you
Loving, missing, crying,
All I want is to be
I’m running, but I’m falling
I’m standing and keep going.

There’s no way to start again

I will leave these days behind
You will see this should be right
There’s no way to start again
Run away…

No one else just you and me
Stayed apart and feeling free
There’s no way to start again
Run away…

Loving, missing, crying,
Go on I will find you
Screaming, loosing, waiting
I’m staying beside you
Loving, missing, crying,
All I want is to be
I’m running, but I’m falling
I’m standing and keep going.

Loving, missing, crying,
Go on I will find you
Screaming, losing, waiting
I’m staying beside you
Loving, missing, crying,
All I want is to be
I’m running, but I’m falling
I’m standing and keep going.

Loving, missing, crying
Screaming, losing, waiting
Loving, missing, crying
I’m running, but I’m falling
I’m standing and keep going.

Loving, missing, crying,
Go on I will find you
Screaming, loosing, waiting
I’m staying beside you
Loving, missing, crying,
All I want is to be
I’m running, but I’m falling
I’m standing and keep going.

There’s no way to start again
