PANTS || A D | Bm E | A D | Bm E ||

A         D
Beautiful mornings,
Bm         E
beautiful nights,
A       D        Bm       E      
amazing colors of the twilight
A         D
Memories whisper,
Bm      E
memories sigh
A         D
You and I together
Bm              E
before you said goodbye

PIEDZ | C Em | Am | Dm G | Dm G | C Em | Am | Dm | F G ||
C             Em
Welcome to my country
Am               Am
but here you don't belong
Dm            G      Dm                  G
Stay with me forever, stay as long as you want
C             Em
Welcome to my country
Am              Am
but here you're bound to fall
Dm              Dm       F                  G                                            
Don't you hear me crying, don't you hear my call

PANTS || A D | Bm E | A D | Bm E ||

A     D
Imaginations
Bm       E
Illusory date
A           D
I came with flowers
Bm                 E
I guess I came too late
A             D
Like a praire fire
Bm          E
you made me see



A                     D
That the bridges are burnt down
    Bm               D
and I got down on my knees

PIEDZ || C Em | Am | Dm G | Dm G | C Em | Am | Dm | F G ||

Welcome to my country
but here you don't belong
Stay with me forever, stay as long as you want
Welcome to my country
but here you're bound to fall
Don't you hear me crying, don't you hear my call

PANTS || A D | Bm E | A D | Bm E ||

Beautiful mornings,
beautiful nights,
amazing colors of the twilight
Time's kind of passed by
as I remember the past
Where are you now
I cried out at last

PIEDZ | C Em | Am | Dm G | Dm G | C Em | Am | Dm | F G ||

Welcome to my country
but here you don't belong
Stay with me forever, stay as long as you want
Welcome to my country
but here you're bound to fall
Don't you hear me crying, don't you hear my call
