```text
I tried to find an answer in every thing you said
no emptiness in all those dreams that we both had made
I’m running down those streets and the sky is crashing on me
is that satisfaction for you to show how brave you are ..

don’t run away
don’t break me down
‘cause I’ve always loved you
And I always will .. and I ..

sometimes I think that your mind is acting against the 
feelings in your heart
I know I’m not a perfect person but at least I’m true 
to myself
every night in my dreams you are there – so close
one thing I know for sure if you will need me I’ll be 
there by your side ..

don’t run away
don’t break me down
‘cause I’ve always loved you
And I always will .. and I ..

somebody said love’s just a feelin’
but without it can you be alive
love is most beautiful feelin’
you can have in this world .

don’t run away
don’t break me down
‘cause I’ve always loved you
And I always will .. and I ..
