```text
I’m standing on a hill
And I can see far,
But it’s not enough yet
Still can’t reach stars.
I have to climb higher
To see the world wider.

There is no way back.
Gonna keep my way ’till I´ll reach the top.
There is no way back,
My dreams are there, I’ll never stop.

There is no way back.
Gonna keep my way ’till I´ll reach the top.
There is no way back,
My dreams are there, I’ll never stop.

Sometimes I feel like
The world gets too small,
I can hold it in my arms,
Sometimes my heart wants
To scream for something more,
To scream for something new.

There is no way back.
Gonna keep my way ’till I´ll reach the top.
There is no way back,
My dreams are there, I’ll never stop.

There is no way back.
Gonna keep my way ’till I´ll reach the top.
There is no way back,
My dreams are there, I’ll never stop.

I can hold it in my arms,
Sometimes my heart wants
To scream for something more,
To scream for something new.

There is no way back.
Gonna keep my way ’till I´ll reach the top.
There is no way back,
My dreams are there, I’ll never stop.

There is no way back.
Gonna keep my way ’till I´ll reach the top.
There is no way back,
My dreams are there, I’ll never stop.
There is no way back,
My dreams are there, I’ll never stop.
