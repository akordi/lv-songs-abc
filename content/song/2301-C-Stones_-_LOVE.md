You!
No reason to be blue
I know there’s always someone
Exchanging looks with you

Right!
Love is sugary pain
But just put up a smile now
And let it through your veins

Love’s burning bright like sunshine
Love’s always in love with you
And you, and you, and you

  [F] L.O.[G] V.E.
  [C] Don’t forget [Am] about me
  [F] On this [G] Saturday [C] night [Am]

  [F] L.O.[G] V.E.
  [C] I need you [Am] around me
  [F] On this [G] Saturday [C] night [Am]

Feel emotions are released
And wherever they’d take us
I promise
You’ll be pleased

Love’s burning bright like sunshine
Love’s always in love with you
And you, and you, and you

  [F] L.O.[G] V.E.
  [C] Don’t forget [Am] about me
  [F] On this [G] Saturday [C] night [Am]

  [F] L.O.[G] V.E.
  [C] I need you [Am] around me
  [F] On this [G] Saturday [C] night [Am]

  [F] L.O.[G] V.E.
  [C] Don’t forget [Am] about me
  [F] On this [G] Saturday [C] night [Am]

  [F] L.O.[G] V.E.
  [C] I need you [Am] around me
  [F] On this [G] Saturday [C] night [Am]

  [F] L.O.[G] V.E.
  [C] Don’t forget [Am] about me
  [F] On this [G] Saturday [C] night [Am]

  [C] I need you [Am] around me
  [F] On this [G] Saturday [C] night [Am]
