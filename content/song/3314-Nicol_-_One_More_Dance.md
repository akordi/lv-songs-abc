I was shocked by your words:“I wanna be your man.”
There were so many girls I couldn’t understand.
What you really want – just few days romance,
If that is what you want you don’t even have that chance.

I will dance with you all the night,
Let your friends get envy, that’s all right,
Take my hand and, baby, hold me tight.

I just wanna, ah, let you know,
When we dance like that and the lights down low,
Your words sound like a song for my soul.

I wanted not to stop and not to keep on and on,
I wanted you to show me to where you belong,
You ’re baggin’ me, you ’re baggin’ me
To give a little chance,
You ’re baggin’ me, you ’re baggin’ me
For one more dance,

For one more dance.

Put your hands around me ‘cause it feels so right,
I wanna be surrounded with your love tonight.
If that’s for one night stand you`re moving kind of fast,
Don`t forsake, make an end and turn this dance into last.

I will dance with you all the night
Until we get crazy, that’s all right,
Take my hand and, baby, hold me tight.

I just wanna, ah, let you know,
When we dance like that and the lights down low,
Your words sound like a song for my soul.

I wanted not to stop and not to keep on and on,
I wanted you to show me to where you belong,
You ’re baggin’ me, you ’re baggin’ me
To give a little chance,
You ’re baggin’ me, you ’re baggin’ me
For one more dance,

I wanted not, wanted not, not to stop,
I wanted not, I wanted not
To stop and not to keep on,
I wanted you, wanted you, ah, ah, ah,
I wanted you, wanted you
To show me where you belong,
I wanted not to stop, hey!

I wanted not to stop and not to keep on and on,
I wanted you to show me to where you belong,
You ’re baggin’ me, you ’re baggin’ me
To give a little chance,
You ’re baggin’ me, you ’re baggin’ me
For one more dance,

I wanted not to stop and not to keep on and on,
I wanted you to show me to where you belong,
You ’re baggin’ me, you ’re baggin’ me
To give a little chance,
You ’re baggin’ me, you ’re baggin’ me
For one more dance,

I wanted not to stop and not to keep on and on,
I wanted you to show me to where you belong,
You ’re baggin’ me, you ’re baggin’ me
To give a little chance,
You ’re baggin’ me, you ’re baggin’ me
For one more, one more, one more, one more dance, ah!
