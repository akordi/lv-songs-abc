We have to wait, there comes a day
When the sunset shines in our eyes
I will show you a sign, do you have something to say?
We both know what awaits us today

Do you feel the rhythm that comes from a heart?
It is a wonderful feeling inside
My pain disappears and I have no fear
You’re beside me, beside me, beside me

Ooh, you’re my inspiration tonight, ooh…
You, because of you I always will fight
You, you, you, you…
It is a wonderful feeling inside
You, you, you, you…

Here comes the rain, the sky watering us
With golden tears of happiness, what we deserve
And maybe it’s time, let’s fly away
We both know what awaits us today

Do you feel the rhythm that comes from a heart?
It is a wonderful feeling inside
My pain disappears and I have no fear
You’re beside me

Ooh, you’re my inspiration tonight, ooh…
You, because of you I always will fight
You, you, you, you…
It is a wonderful feeling inside
You, you, you, you…

Ooh, you’re my inspiration tonight, ooh…
You, because of you I always will fight
You, you, you, you…
It is a wonderful feeling inside
You, you, you, you…
