Some people don’t understand
Why they always feel so sad
Sing this simple melody
And it might relax your mind

We cannot hide the problems of the world
Pretend like everything’s alright
But everyone who feels depressed
Will sing and join their hands tonight

Let’s sing the song through the night
Because the music sounds so bright
Let’s sing the song through the night
And everything will be alright

So if you’re lonely in your heart
Go along with a simple song
And if you don’t know where to go
It will help you to be strong

Sing the song when you’re happy
Sing the song when you’re lonely
Sing the song even in bad times
Even if it takes all night
Just sing until you feel alright

Let’s sing the song through the night
Because the music sounds so bright
(Because the music sounds so bright)
Let’s sing the song through the night
And everything will be alright (Just sing the song)

Let’s sing the song through the night
Because the music sounds so bright
Let’s sing the song through the night
And everything will be alright

Sing the song, clap your hands
Sing the song, stamp your feet
Sing the song, ’cause everything is gonna be alright

Sing the song, clap your hands
Sing the song, stamp your feet
Everything, everything
Is gonna be alright

Let’s sing the song through the night
(‘Cause everything is gonna be)
Because the music sounds so bright
Let’s sing the song through the night
And everything will be alright

Let’s sing the song through the night
Because the music sounds so bright
Let’s sing the song through the night (Let’s sing the song tonight)
And everything will be alright
And everything will be alright
