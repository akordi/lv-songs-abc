[D] Suddenly my [G] dream is gone and [D] i...
I wake up [G] again and wonder [A] why
I am all out of [F#m] sheep to [Bm] count
Give me [G] more

[D] Now i wish i could [G] hide your [D] smile
Underneath my [G] pillow for a [A] while
Time is going [F#m]  deeper in the [Bm] night
and i [G] leave

[G] Night store has everything and 
I see [A] there's so much

On your [D] right, there's a [G] fire burning [D] bright
and the [G] shelves they seem to [Bm] break
How we [A] wish the ceiling was the [G] sky
but a [A] glass 
full of [D] wine
[G] to be [D] drained
coz you won't [G] escape your [Bm] thirst
better [A] steal and run [G] away
wine is [F#m] mixing with the [G] night
[G] and i just [D] can't
[G] i can't fall [D] asleep

[D] am i number [G] 8 of seven [D] dwarfs
far away from [G] diamonds in their [A] caves
movies lie [F#m] again to you snow- [Bm] white
am i [G] right?

[D] a sheet is turning [G] me into a [D] cloud
i apologize to my [G] bed out [A] loud
so i go to [F#m] steer into the [Bm] night
i go and [G] buy

[G] Night store has everything and 
I see [A] there's so much

On your [D] right, there's a [G] fire burning [D] bright
and the [G] shelves they seem to [Bm] break
How we [A] wish the ceiling was the [G] sky
but a [A] glass 
full of [D] wine
[G] to be [D] drained
coz you won't [G] escape your [Bm] thirst
better [A] steal and run [G] away
wine is [F#m] mixing with the [G] night
[G] and i just [D] can't
[G] i can't fall [D] asleep
