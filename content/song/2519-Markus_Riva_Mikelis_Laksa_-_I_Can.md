```text
One more day, one more night
Hard to say what’s on my mind
I tried, I tried

Every thought on my mind
Makes me feel that love is blind
This time, this time

I will follow, follow you
I will follow, follow you

I can, I can almost feel the sea
I can do anything to see you again
Yes I can, I can write your memories
‘Cause that is all we need to stay alive
And I really wanna see you again

Then the storms that we survive
They let me back to life
I tried, you know that I tried

Now that you are next to me
I can feel infinity again
I feel alive

I will follow, follow you
I will follow, follow you

I can, I can almost feel the sea
I can do anything to see you again
Yes I can, I can write your memories
‘Cause that is all we need to stay alive
And I really wanna see you again

I can, yes I can
I can, I can see you again
I can, yes I can
I can

I will follow, follow you
I will follow, follow you

I can, I can almost feel the sea
I can do anything to see you again
Yes I can, I can write your memories
‘Cause that is all we need to stay alive
And I really wanna see you again

I can almost feel the sea
I can do anything to see you again
Yes I can, I can write your memories
‘Cause that is all we need to stay alive
And I really wanna see you again.
