[Verse 1]
One step closer to you
Makes me wanna hold you
Like there will be no tomorrow
Someday, I can call you my forever
But now, I'm patiently waiting for you
Days go by and I'm counting more months
That we had it all together
You are the only reason
I'm fighting harder and higher


[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah) I have that feeling
(Ah) Now It's time

[Chorus]
Can we stay in this night
Now, then forever? (Forever)
One more dance with you
Now, then forever (Forever)
Can we stay in this night
Now, then forever? (Forever)
One more dance with you
Now, then forever and ever

[Verse 2]
Your eyes are telling me the story
Of your broken heart
That is never ever gonna hear you smile
Let me be the one who's gonna
Restore your gravity, baby

[Verse 3]
Everything we had will now be lost forever
Yesterday is now, so far away from Heaven
Put your hand in mine
And start to stand together
Higher and higher

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah) I have that feeling
(Ah) Now It's time

[Chorus]
Can we stay in this night
Now, then forever? (Forever)
One more dance with you
Now, then forever (Forever)
Can we stay in this night
Now, then forever? (Forever)
One more dance with you
Now, then forever and ever

[Bridge]
Forever

[Chorus]
Can we stay in this night
Now, then forever? (Forever)
One more dance with you
Now, then forever (Forever)
Can we stay in this night
Now, then forever? (Forever)
One more dance with you
Now, then forever and ever
