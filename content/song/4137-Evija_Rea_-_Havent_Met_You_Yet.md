Hey I haven't met you yet
Blank paper's laying on my desk
Gonna think of perfect picture to draw for you
Pen is shaking in my hand
It's just scared to make a mistake
You know, I'll draw who you are 
'Cause you're perfect as you are anyway


I know you're gonna stumble
But I know you're gonna reach it,
I know you're gonna rock our world
I know you will be jumping
But I know you will be landing
And I know you're gonna rock our world


You're another new note
On the manuscript paper
It's strong and it's visible as it hasn't dried yet
Don't let it dry
Don't let it fade
Make steps out of clouds 
you're heart will make your song... anyway


I know you're gonna stumble
But I know you're gonna reach it,
I know you're gonna rock our world
I know you will be jumping
But I know you will be landing
And I know you're gonna rock our world


Hey I haven't met you yet
And you don't know that yet
But with the first breath you take
You're gonna change,
You're gonna change,
You're gonna change our lives.... anyway


I know you're gonna stumble
But I know you're gonna reach it,
I know you're gonna rock our world
I know you will be jumping
But I know you will be landing
And I know you're gonna rock our world


mmm.....
I know you're gonna stumble
I know you're gonna reach it,
I know you're gonna rock our world
