[Verse 1]
When I forgot to call you back
You locked the door, you said you're over it
You didn't speak any sense
How many times did we go through it?
I guess I finally lost my patience
I'm done with fighting without a reason
Don't need no conversations
Need some isolation, separate locations

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you run away
Wish you could come back again
Waiting for the summertime
To realize we're out of line
Paralyzed tryna find paradise


[Chorus]
Now we're just strangers
Waiting to be found by somebody else
Nothing's gonna change us
Taking another sit by runways

[Post-Chorus]
Paralyzed tryna find paradisе
Now we're just strangers
Waiting to bе found by somebody else

[Verse 2]
Now we're leaving different time zones
But I sometimes think about you
Watching house we're moved out from
Gives me shivers every time

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every time you run away
Wish you could come back again
Waiting for the summertime
To realize we're out of line
Paralyzed, tryna find paradise

[Chorus]
Now we're just strangers
Waiting to be found by somebody else
Nothing's gonna change us
Taking another sit by runways

[Post-Chorus]
Paralyzed tryna find paradise
Now we're just strangers
Waiting to be found by somebody else

[Bridge]
I won't make one more confession
There are moments and I question
"Was us the choice that you didn't made?"
But more I see, [?][2:21] fades away

[Chorus]
Now we're just strangers
Waiting to be found by somebody else
Nothing's gonna change us
Taking another sit by runways (Runway)
Paralyzed tryna find paradise
Now we're just strangers
Waiting to be found by somebody else
