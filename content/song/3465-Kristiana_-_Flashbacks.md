```text
It felt simple when we met
Late night walks and gentle hands
I never dreamed of what turned real
Eyes closed, you kiss me tenderly
 
But what went wrong and when did we
Drive off the road so easily?
Not much was changed, that's what you said
But I saw all the colours turning grey
 
And now I wish that you would know
Love we had still burns somehow
Flashbacks take me back to you
We lived a dream until it broke
 
I know we crashed and we've been down
I know we crashed and we've been down
Give us a chance
We lived a dream until it broke
 
I know we crashed and we've been down
I know we crashed and we've been down
Give us a chance
We lived a dream until it broke
 
I know that good things never last
Too long but felt like we would pass
This border here is bittersweet
Slow dancing on an empty street
 
And now I wish that you would know
Love we had still burns somehow
Flashbacks take me back to you
We lived a dream until it broke
 
I know we crashed and we've been down
I know we crashed and we've been down
Give us a chance
We lived a dream until it broke
 
I know we crashed and we've been down
I know we crashed and we've been down
Give us a chance
We lived a dream until it broke
 
Nights are lonely without you
Can I lay next to you?
Nights are lonely without you
Can I lay next to you?
 
I know we crashed and we've been down
I know we crashed and we've been down
Give us a chance
We lived a dream until it broke
 
I know we crashed and we've been down
I know we crashed and we've been down
Give us a chance
We lived a dream until it broke
 
I know we crashed and we've been down
I know we crashed and we've been down
Give us a chance
We lived a dream until it broke
