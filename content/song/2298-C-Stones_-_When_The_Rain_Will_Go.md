How [C] many days, how [Em] many ways
[F] Should I go to [C] find a place
Where [F] heaven means to [C] stay in love
[F] With a single [G] heart

How [C] many days, how [Em] many ways
[F] Should I try to [C] find a face
Who’d [F] say hey don’t [C] worry babe
[F] I’m in love with [G] you

  [C] Every corner of my [Em] heart
  Makes me feel so worried
  [F] Looking for the courage
  [G] To be true

  [C] Every corner of my [Em] mind
  Kills my feelings softly
  [F] Now I try to understand
  Is this the [G] road which leads to the end

  [C] Hello
  Can you say when the rain will [Am] go
  Being such a [F] fool
  I always mix up [G] tears
  With rain drops in my [C] dreams

  Can you say when the rain will [Am] go
  Being such a [F] fool
  I always mix up [G] tears
  With rain drops in my [C] dreams

I [C] try to walk, I [Em] try to talk
You [F] see it hurts when [C] no one knows
To [F] show the way how [C] to get away
[F] By the way I’ve [G] stocked

How [C] many days, how [Em] any ways
[F] Will it take to [C] find that place
Deep [F] in my heart I’m [C] not so smart
[F] I’ve lost in [G] space

  [C] Every corner of my [Em] heart
  Makes me feel so worried
  [F] Looking for the courage
  [G] To be true

  [C] Every corner of my [Em] mind
  Kills my feelings softly
  [F] Now I try to understand
  Is this the [G] road which leads to the end

  [C] Hello
  Can you say when the rain will [Am] go
  Being such a [F] fool
  I always mix up [G] tears
  With rain drops in my [C] dreams

  Can you say when the rain will [Am] go
  Being such a [F] fool
  I always mix up [G] tears
  With rain drops in my [C] dreams
