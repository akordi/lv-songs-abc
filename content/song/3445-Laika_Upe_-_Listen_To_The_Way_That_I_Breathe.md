```text
You keep lying
Eyes glued to the ceiling
I keep scratching
Until you come falling down from the plaster

What a disaster, your stare is red
Your hands are sewn to the bed
The liquids that we used
Are floating safe in a drain
Now flush them from your brain

Listen to the way that I breathe
My heartbeat, the way I speak
Take the troubles on my soul
Might not take back control

Take the troubles on my soul
Might not take back control

Listen to the way that I breathe
My heartbeat, the way I speak
Face the troubles on my soul
Might not take back control

Take the troubles on my soul
Might not take back control

Are you back
Or just planning to attack
The words you speak are sweet
But somehow I see through you

The demons still hold true!
But one day you’ll be the way you used to
And you’ll breathe and sing with everything
That’s around you!

Listen to the way that I breathe
My heartbeat, the way I speak
Take the troubles on my soul
Might not take back control

Take the troubles on my soul
Might not take back control

Listen to the way that I breathe
My heartbeat, the way I speak
Take the troubles on my soul
Might not take back control

Take the troubles on my soul
Might not take back control

Listen to the way that I breathe
My heartbeat, the way I speak
Take the troubles on my soul
Might not take back control

Take the troubles on my soul
Might not take back control
