```text
Footsteps in my heart 
You left them walking away from me 
Now that we’re apart 
The loneliness is all I see 
The bridge is falling down 
Call your name around and around.. 
Around  You turned your back on me 
A thousand times before 
I’m sick and hopeless laying here 
And praying at your door 
I don’t need anything 
But the thing 
I know for sure 
I need your love 
I need your cure  
Days are running fast 
Now that I’m away from you 
Faces come and go 
But yours the one 
I’m searching for 
The places I have been 
There’s always just an empty scene
