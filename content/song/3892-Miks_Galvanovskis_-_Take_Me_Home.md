[1. pants]
Catch me if it`s not too late,
I promise this is our faith,
We keep going on.
Play with me just one last song,
Stay with me till we gray and old,
This is our last hope...

Oh, let`s go.

[2. pants]
Let me fly with you in space,
Tell me words you have never said,
Take me where I'm not afraid.
Let`s set our hearts on the same beat,
And play our songs on repeat,
For the rest of the night, we will be free.

[Pirms piedz.]
So close your eyes,
Let love guide,
By my side. 

[Piedz.]
Take me, honey, back home,
Let me walk my childhood rodes,
Take me there where I can see so we,
Can dance with moon all night long,
And play for stars our love song,
Bring me there where I belong.

Oh, where I belong.

[Pirms piedz.]
Oh, take me back home, where we first met,
Before the hair was growing on my chest,
Where fields are full of blueberries and the morning 
rain is masterpiece.
It`s not too late, our time has come,
We sing with night and morning sun,
I`m so proud what we become but i still wanna be young.

[Piedz.]
Take me honey back to home
Let me walk my childhood rodes
Take me there where i can see so we
Can dance with moon all night long
And play for stars our love song
Bring me there where i belong

[Piedz.]
Take me honey back to home
Let me walk my childhood rodes
Take me there where i can see so we
Can dance with moon all night long
And play for stars our love song
Bring me there where i belong

Where I belong

Take me back home, where I belong.
Take me back home, where I belong.

Oh, let`s go.
