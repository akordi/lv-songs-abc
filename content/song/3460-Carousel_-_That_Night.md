It was a lonely night
No stars were shining, there was no light
One troubled thought broke through
And colored my world so blue
 
Lo-o-o-o-ove where are you?
Lo-o-o-o-ove I need you
Lo-o-o-o-ove all night through
Where are you, my love? Oh
 
I travelled through the time
It felt for me like doing a crime
My mind did crazy things
Imagination opened their wings
 
A river dark as cold
It took me far away from the shore
Please come to me till sunrise
And take me back to my paradise
 
Lo-o-o-o-ove where are you?
Lo-o-o-o-ove I need you
Lo-o-o-o-ove all night through
Where are you, my love? Oh
 
Lo-o-o-o-ove where are you?
Lo-o-o-o-ove I need you
Lo-o-o-o-ove all night through
Where are you, my love? Oh
 
Love... Love...
Lo-o-o-o-ove where are you?
Lo-o-o-o-ove I need you
Lo-o-o-o-ove all night through
Where are you, my love? Oh
 
Lo-o-o-o-ove where are you?
Lo-o-o-o-ove I need you
Lo-o-o-o-ove all night through
Where are you, my love? Where are you?
