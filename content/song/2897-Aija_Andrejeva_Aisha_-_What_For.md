```text
I've asked my angels, why?
But they don’t know
What for do mothers cry
And rivers flow?
Why are the skies so blue
And mountains high?
What for is your love always passing by?

I’ve asked my uncle Joe
But he can't speak
Why does the wind still blow?
And blood still leak?
So many questions now
With no reply
What for do people live until they die?

Chorus:
What for are we living?
What for are we crying?
What for are we dying?
Only Mr. God knows why
What for are we living?
What for are we dreaming?
What for are we loosing?
Only Mr. God knows why

(But) His phone today is out of range

The sun that's painted black
Is rising high
The time is turning back
I wonder why
So many questions now
With no reply
What for do people live until they die?
