                Dm          G             F                C
You power out, out of reach, lost connection between you and me x2

C                 Dm     
Searching in your face    
 Am                    G
For something I could believe in
C                                Dm
Where are the toothpaste lines I drew
      Am         G
While you were asleep

C           Dm    
Voice so distant 
        Am         G
Your message isn't clear
G                D#    
I don't feel the tears, 
            C
I'm water resistant

                Dm             G
You power out, out of reach
        F               C
Lost connection between you and me
               Dm         G
You power out, now I see
       F                C
Lost affection, nothing left for me

Am              G#             C
You have turned into a note outside my harmony
Am              G#                   C
You have turned into a note been outside my mind
Am              G#             C
No one talks on silent phones, but the picture's clear
       Am                 G#             C
'Cause you never tell me, you just disappear


                Dm          G
You power out, out of reach
        F               C
Lost connection between you and me
               Dm         G 
You power out, now I see
        F               C
Lost affection, nothing left for me

                Dm          G        
You power out, out of reach, 
      F               C
lost connection between you and me x2
