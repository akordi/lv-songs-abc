Wheels on the runway 
It's a Friday
Flyin' for the weekend
Sittin' on a freeway
Hangin' all day
For the night that we spend with
Friday Family
Friday Family
Hit me up and watch me explode

Same time at the same place
Bring your game face
And a bottle of your finest
We gonna replace
Ya headspace
And your pretty little outfit
Friday Family
Friday Family
All you gotta do is pick up your phone

City lights are calling you home
My Friday Family
Friday Family
My Friday Family
Oh!
We'll be hangin' from the ceiling
My Friday Family
Friday Family
My Friday Family
Oh!
It's a special kind of feeling

Bodies in the kitchen
With the rhythm
A fire in the courtyard
Pretty little women
On a mission
Gonna party like a pornstar
My Friday Family
Friday Family
Dance until there's holes in the floor
Till the cops come break down the door

My Friday Family
Friday Family
My Friday Family
Oh!
We'll be hangin' from the ceiling
My Friday Family
Friday Family
My Friday Family
Oh!
It's a special kind of feeling

My Friday Family
Friday Family
My Friday Family
Friday Family

My Friday Family
Friday Family
My Friday Family
Oh!
We'll be hangin' from the ceiling
My Friday Family
Friday Family
My Friday Family
Oh!
It's a special kind of feeling
