Em C G D

I used to drink coca cola
And eat in McDonalds
I sipped whiskey
On lonely Saturday nights

But now i am gonna be a christian christian christian if you want me to
I am gonna be a christian christian christian if you want me to
Well if you want me to

I used to go to different gurus
Laugh at Jesus Christ
And when you came to me that day
I thought that all you said was lies

But now i am gonna be a christian christian christian if you want me to
I am gonna be a christian christian christian if you want me to
Well if you want me to

I used to make a lot of chicks,
And watched Hollywood movies
roll joints
In ancient Indian cities

but now i am gonna be a christian christian christian if you want me to
i am gonna be a christian christian christian if you want me to
mmm am gonna be a christian christian christian if you want me to
i am gonna be a christian christian christian if you want me to
well if you want me to
well if you want me to
well if you want me to
well if you want me to
well if you want me to
