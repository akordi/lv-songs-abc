Wherever I go
I´ll be drifting on the sideways
I´ll be carving skins of pleasure
Till I find home

Whomever I hold
Fills my lungs but I am savage
Trapped in songs and old French movies
That´s how I lie

You don´t know me, you don´t know me
When the evening is gone
When no one can tell our roles
When lonely is fire in our bones

You don´t know me, you don´t know me
When the morning is bold
When no one can tell our roles
When lonely is fire in our bones

No matter how long
In the storms I won´t be afraid to drown
You can take my hand but don´t believe it´s warmth
Cuz I need to fight this alone

Whomever I hold
Fills my lungs but I am savage
Trapped in songs and old French movies
That´s how I lie

You don´t know me, you don´t know me
When the evening is gone
When no one can tell our roles
When lonely is fire in our bones

You don´t know me, you don´t know me
When the morning is bold
When no one can tell our roles
When lonely is fire in our bones

You don´t know me, you don´t know me
You don´t know me, you don´t know me
You don´t know me, you don´t know me
You don´t know me, you don´t know me
