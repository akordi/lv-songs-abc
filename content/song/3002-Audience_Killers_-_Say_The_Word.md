```text
There’something in the water
Deep down burning fire, there
Remember how it got there
You left me at summer day

  Oh, when you are near to me
  I don’t know how to breath
  I can see right through you
  Reflection of me and you

Just say the word, say the word
Just say the word, say the word

With every stare i glow
Time there seems like follow lay
It’s not that I have never
Planned for always better day

Just say the word

Taste is always sorrow
Used up all my arrows
Key of hidden treasure
Bird that lost it’s feathers

Everything seems a dream
I can tell you
What city hides at night
I can show you

  Oh, when you are near to me
  I don’t know how to breath
  I can see right through you
  Reflection of me and you
