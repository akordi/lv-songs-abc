I remember when
The dream was over
I felt kinda sad
And now I feel so odd
I need to get there back now

Oh, I got a secret to hold on to
Oh, lookin’ for place to hide from you

I went to my childhood place
Climbed in my favourite tree in black and white
Saw my beloved ones watchin’ Jim and Kurt
Playin’ badminton and both them won

I felt uplifted and so I flew
Over the hills and the morning dew
I felt so alive long ago
Don’t know where I’m going but I have to go

Oh, I got a secret to hold on to
Oh, looking for place to hide from you
Oh, I got a secret to hold on to
Oh, looking for place to hide from you

Ah, I got a secret
Ah, I got a secret to hold

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, I got a secret
I got a secret to hold
