[F] I wake up in [C] the midnight 
It’s [G] so quiet (shhh...) so quiet
[F] This silience makes me sick
[C] I walk alone [G] in the moonlight
It’s [E] so quiet (shhh...) so quiet
[F] Just me and [G] thousands of stars

  [F] There i [C] want to be there
  [G] Between bright [Am] shiny stars
  [F] On the [C] top of the moon
  [G] So far [Am] away from here

[F] There is nobody [C] simply empty streets
[G] It’s so quiet [Am] I can’t believe i’m here
[F] Am i dreaming [C] or am i sleeping?
[G] It’s so quiet [Am] I rise my head up high

  [F] There i [C] want to be there
  [G] Between bright [Am] shiny stars
  [F] On the [C] top of the moon
  [G] So far [Am] away from here

[F] So far away
[C] So far away
[G] So far away
[Am] So far away

  [F] There i [C] want to be there
  [G] Between bright [Am] shiny stars
  [F] On the [C] top of the moon
  [G] So far [Am] away from here

  [F] There i [C] want to be there
  [G] Between bright [Am] shiny stars
  [F] On the [C] top of the moon
  [G] So far [Am] away from here
