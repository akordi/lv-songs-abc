There are so many places, so many things to see
So many different faces, but, baby, look at me
I know the scenic mountain where you would go uphill
So I know we start dreaming of some vicious devil feel

But if you let me lead you because you want to know
Don’t hesitate, my darling, just take my hand and go

Hey, boy, follow me if you want to see the sky
Hey, boy, follow me, baby, just you and I
Hey, boy, follow me, I’ll be your happy guide
‘Cause when we walk across my world you’ll be my guiding light

You have to hear my ocean, to see my land is wide
To feel my deep devotion, experience my light
But if you think a stranger is better guiding you
I’ll try to understand that if I’m a stranger, too

But if you let me lead you because you want to know
Don’t hesitate, my darling, just take my hand and go

Hey, boy, follow me if you want to see the sky
Hey, boy, follow me, baby, just you and I
Hey, boy, follow me, I’ll be your happy guide
‘Cause when we walk across my world you’ll be my guiding light

Hey, boy, follow me if you want to see the sky
Hey, boy, follow me, baby, just you and I
Hey, boy, follow me, I’ll be your happy guide
‘Cause when we walk across my world you’ll be my guiding light

Hey, boy, follow me if you want to see the sky
Hey, boy, follow me, baby, just you and I
Hey, boy, follow me, I’ll be your happy guide
So, baby, follow-up all on me to be my guiding light
