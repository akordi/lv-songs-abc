I’m a music thief, I steal melodies
All the best of the hits, of the hits
All the people wanna dance to my beats, to my beats

I steal lyrics too, I’m a plagiarist
Let it be, move your feet, move your feet
To the music of my hit crazy hit, super hit
Hoo-hah

Pretty woman, you’re devil in disguise
Living in a yellow submarine
Welcome to the hotel gangsta’s paradise
The winner takes it all, my dancing queen
Billie Jean

My song is very cool because it’s meaningless
Just a joke for your kids, for your kids
To the lyrics of the most famous hits, only hits

Yes, I’m a criminal who’s looking for success
What a shame I’m a thief, I’m a thief
But I wanna just the fame to receive, to receive
Hoo-hah

Love me tender, love me sleeping in my car
Every breath you take I’m watching you
Du hast mich gefragt, is whiskey in the jar?
Mamma mia, mamma, oh oh oh
Love me do

Now let’s listen to the opera
I stole it too, it’s not a sin
Great amount of hits is all around
For Eurosong, and I must win

Girls, boys, gimme gimme 12 points
It’s a weapon of choice, take a chance on me
Because I have a dream

Hey, jury, please don’t call the police
My robbery streak, so funny, funny freak
I’m a music gangsta who wanna be a star
Like Jesus Christ, are you surprised?

Yesterday you told me about the blue blue sky
All my troubles seem so far away
La isla bonita, time to say goodbye
Voyage voyage, surf in USA
Slide away

La lalalalalalalala lalala lalala
Great amount of hits is all around
For Eurosong, and I must win
