Words that you speak
They don’t mean a thing to me
But once, for a moment
They were the only thing that I could hear

But I don’t care anymore
I set it on, on fire

It’s amazing
What a fool I used to be
What did I do?

It’s amazing
I was blind but now I see
What would you do?

I set it on, set it on, on fire
I set it on, set it on, on fire
I set it on, set it on, on fire
I set it on, set it on, on fire

Round up them all
All my insecurities
Light up the lighter and throw
Let the fire swallow my fears

But I don’t care anymore
I set it on, on fire
(I’mma set it on, on, on)
And I don’t care anymore
I set it on, on fire

It’s amazing
What a fool I used to be
What did I do?

It’s amazing
I was blind but now I see
What would you do?

I set it on, set it on, on fire
I set it on, set it on, on fire
I set it on, set it on, on fire (What would you do?)
I set it on, set it on, on fire (What would you do?)

I set it on, set it on, on fire (What would you say?)
I set it on, set it on, on fire (What would you do?)
I set it on, set it on, on fire (What would you say?)
I set it on, set it on, on fire

I set it on, set it on
I set it on, set it on
I set it on, set it on, on fire
