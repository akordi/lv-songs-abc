```text
are you full of blame
it's alright
we all do
you start new life every morning  don't you
it's alright
we do so

i know throught the smoke i saw boy crying
but my old eyes may lie
(2x)

are you afraid of tomorrow
it's alright
we all do
you never know  you fade out quietly and slowly
it's alright
we all do

i know throught the smoke i saw boy crying
but my old eyes may lie
(2x)

i know throught the smoke i saw boy crying
but my old eyes may lie
(6x)
```
