I’m not the girl you knew
That just be pleasin’ you
Keepin your lies on low
Like nothin’ happened, yo

You better pack your bags and leave
Before I call somebody to kick you out

Oh, you think I’m such a fool
Playin’ it down freakin’ cool
Smile and kiss goodnight
I have my own surprise

You better chip these pictures bills
And racy videos about you I’ve got

Let me tell you boy, it’s not easy to say goodbye
Not even if I try, I’m gonna live my life without you
Though, it’s crazy that I’m still holding you around
I know that my life will be better without you
Without you, yeah

Don’t make that kinda face
Or your surprise, don’t say
I heard it all before
Doesn’t know be no more

You better look at me and tell the truth
Don’t touch me, take your stupid smile off

Whoah yes, I am smarter now
I’m feelin’ stronger now
I’m not about to cry
I’m gonna be alright

You better can it, know that we are through
Forget the story and wish me good luck

Let me tell you boy, it’s not easy to say goodbye
Not even if I try, I’m gonna live my life without you
Though, it’s crazy that I’m still holding you around
I know that my life will be better without you
Without you, yeah

She’s not a lover, she’s not a friend
I think you just covered, this is the end
And I should’ve told you this before
That I don’t need you anymore

Let me tell you boy… (it’s not easy to say goodbye)
Not even if I try, I’m gonna live my life without you
Though, it’s crazy that I’m still holding you around
I know that my life will be better without you

It’s not easy to say goodbye, not even if I try
I’m gonna live my life without you
Though, it’s crazy that I’m still holding you around
I know that my life will be better without you
Without you, yeah
