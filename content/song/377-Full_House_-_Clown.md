E         B
Once long time ago
A    
I knew some girl
A
She fool'd me so
E
She take my hand
B
She show me way
A
She told sweet words
A
And not that all

Some day latter
Meet her on the street
Don't wanna see her
But she did
She came to me and said so
She came to me and said:

C#m         F#m
"Uh, boy, I miss You so
A                Am
You are my dream You are my love
C#m                F#m
You're so cute and you're so nice
A                       Am
Can't You see you're my pardise"

E      B             A
I dont wanna be your fool
B
For one night
    E        B            A
And I don't wanna be your clown


Week latter -
Same place
She said:
"Boy I miss your face"
Sweet words
And not that all
I begin to trust her

There was hot night
We're kissin' high
And do the things
What we never did
```
