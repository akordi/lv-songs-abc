```text
I remember myself, I remember myself tired and weak,
Walking around these old, these old city streets,

That was the Friday night you came along,
For quite a long time we were alone,
And then I thought,

That's the same story, the same love
Coming this way, coming my way 
Coming this way, coming my way

And now we're here, and now we're here standing like before,
Should I trust, should I trust your eyes this time,

'Cause nothing prepared us to fall again,
But maybe that that's what this life is about
And then I thought,

That's the same story, the same love,
Coming this way, coming my way

But this time keep me closer, this time keep me closer,
Closer than before
