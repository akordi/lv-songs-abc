All my 74 brave soldiers
Couldn’t save my country today
-silly queen – i had to tell myself
-where were your thoughts yesterday-

as i fed my own monsters in my bed
had ambitions high as the Great wall
dancing tango on the sharpest edge
i was crazy believing i would not fall.

Where’s the key to peace - And how much does it cost?
I can not put together my hundred thoughts
Even money can not save what was built on dirt
The bricks of my castle are falling apart slowly.

I would even dare to strip away my soul
If i’d only believe it could help
But it only drags my emptiness deeper
As i search for the crown lost in hell

But i’m calm calm calm
As an apple on the ground
I know – my seeds will still grow
Therefore i know
i need
A new sun indeed
And it’s gonna be:
Bright and apple green!
