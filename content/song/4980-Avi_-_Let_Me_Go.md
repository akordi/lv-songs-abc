[Verse 1]
Lock me up, lock me up, only way to keep me
Lock me up, lock me up, and push me into deep sea
I know, I know there's no escape in you, oh (Mm, mm)
 
[Verse 2]
Drowning, stumbling, taking breaths in this cold water
I'm hoping to see the shore
But with every move I sing more
Why can't you let go? Why can't you let go?
 
[Pre-Chorus]
The distance seem so small
But still, I have to, still I pray to God
You let me go
 
[Chorus]
I pray to God, you let me go (Just let me... I pray to...)
I pray to God, you let me go (Just let me... I pray to, I pray to God)
I try, I try to leave, but every time you
You make me, make me bleed
When try to push through
I pray to God, I pray to God
You let me go (Just let me, just let me, I pray to)
 
[Verse 3]
This is good, mouth is dried out
And there's nothing else to say here
I'm putting on the disguise
Just so I could keep you in the lines
Why can't you let go? (Go, oh)
Why can't you, you let go? Mm, hmm
 
[Verse 4]
I can't explain why
You make me weak underneath some cotton
Now please, just to keep me inside
Build me up and knock me down
But no one hears the sound
Now, I want you to cry
I want you begging for mercy
Hopping you're worthy, screaming you're sorry
Everything's blurry, then maybe you'll see
I mean my best
 
[Chorus]
When I pray to God, you let me go (Just let me... I pray to...)
I pray to God, you let me go (Just let me... I pray to, I pray to God)
I try, I try to leave, but every time you
You make me, make me bleed
When try to push through
I pray to God, I pray to God
You let me go (Just let me, just let me, I pray to)
 
[Outro]
Just let me go
