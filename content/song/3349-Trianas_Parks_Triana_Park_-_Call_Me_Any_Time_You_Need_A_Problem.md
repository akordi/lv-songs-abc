```text
You’re only joking in your own skin
You’re only losing everything you’ve got within
You’re feeling like you wanna get out
You’re feeling like you wanna get in

I see you’re feeling low, like a mouse in a cage
I see you’re feeling low, like an actor with no stage
I see the problem, I see the cause
I am the problem, that’s what you’re feeling insecure

I am the problem, I am the cause
Of your never-ending tricks with your thousand little whores
I am the devil living in your little head
I am the nightmare waiting in your cosy bed

I am the problem
I am the problem
I am the problem
I am the problem

I see you’re feeling low, like a mouse in a cage
I see you’re feeling low, like an actor with no stage
I see the problem, I see the cause
I am the problem, that’s what you’re feeling insecure

I am the problem
I am the problem
I am the problem
I am the problem

Your black heart is so cruel
Love is not just a tool
Black as charcoal, it’s cake
I’m your sweetest mistake

I am the problem, I am the cause
Of your never-ending tricks with your thousand little whores
I am the devil living in your little head
I am the nightmare waiting in your cosy bed

I am the problem, problem, problem
(I am the problem) I am the thing you seek
(I am the problem) Call me anytime you need
(I am the problem) I am the thing you seek
(I am the problem) Call me anytime you need

(I am the problem) I am the thing you seek
(I am the problem) Call me anytime you need
(I am the problem) I am the thing you seek
(I am the problem) Call me anytime
Call me anytime you need a problem
