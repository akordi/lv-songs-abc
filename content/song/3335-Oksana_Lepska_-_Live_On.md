```text
You tried it so hard again and again
But all you can do now is crying in the rain
Your castles are fallen, your heroes are few
And now you’re looking for someone to believe in you

Impossible is nothing, I know for sure
And for the deepest heartache there is a cure
Impossible is nothing, I want you to know
No matter how you suffered now all you gotta do is live on

Some river are flowing through the desert heat
Some candles keep burning, even in the wind
Away hesitation, just do what is true
And let me be someone to believe in you

Impossible is nothing, I want you to know
To matter how you suffered now all you gotta do is live on

Live on, live on
Live on, live on
Live on, live on
Live on, live on
```
