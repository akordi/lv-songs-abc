Hey, honey, hey
Say what you wanted so long
Let your tin drums play
Let your tin drums play

Burn, honey, burn
Oh it's the one–way highway with no return
Well we have a lot to go

We can save
We can save it all
For the winter’s day
And we can make
We can make it all
In a different way
Much better way

Leave, honey, leave
Leave all confessions of thieves
While we have a song
While we have a song

Rush, honey, rush
And if you open these doors
We won’t be ignored by love
Hear the tin drums play

We can save
We can save it all
For the winter’s day
And we can make
We can make it all
In a different way
Much better way

Going in autumn
Going in autumn
Going in autumn

We can save
We can save it all
For the winter’s day
And we can make
We can make it all
In a different way

We can save
We can save it all
And we can make
We can make it all
In a different way
Much better way

Hey, honey, hey
Say what you wanted so long
Let your tin drums play
Let your tin drums play
