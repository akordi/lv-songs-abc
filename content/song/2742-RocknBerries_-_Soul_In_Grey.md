```text
The one that got away 
Will never find the way 
The one that ran away 
Will never understand  
That the grass won’t be greener 
The vine won't taste the same 
The grass won’t be greener 
If your soul is grey  
The one that got away 
Keeps playing the same old game 
The one that ran away 
Will never feel the same  
Cause the grass won’t be greener 
The vine won't taste the same 
The grass won’t be greener 
If your soul is grey  
Your soul is grey
