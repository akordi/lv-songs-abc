```text
I play my funky music tonight 
It makes me high it feels so right 
I play my funky music all night 
Wanna feel you dancing by my side  
When the lights are gone 
You catch my vibes and 
I Take your soul tonight  
I play my funky music tonight 
I wanna see you move your body right 
Move those legs to the left and right 
And let me see you freaky tonight  
When the lights are gone 
You catch my vibes and 
I Take your soul tonight
