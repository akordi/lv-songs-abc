intro  Fm Ab Eb Db

Cm       Fm                        Ab
   It's closing time, where do we go now?
      Fm                       Eb         Ab
You've something to say and I don't care how
                  Eb
But you bite your tongue
                        Fm                   Eb     Fm
Hey apathy, you turn me on and on and on and on and on
            Eb       Db        Eb
You secrets speak louder in acedia 


Chorus:
    (Ab)    Fm                  Ab
 My teasing mime, you're losing soul
        Eb             Fm
 My monument of cannel coal
     Eb      Ab             Fm
 We fit like crime and criminal
         Eb              Fm  Ab  Eb  Db
 I stay shelter, not a home


Cm    Fm                         Ab
   On bending knees one hundred million miles I'd go
Fm                         Eb       Db
   Gritting teeth 'cause I want you so
                    Eb
 But you bite your tongue and you know damn' well that this way
      Ab         Fm                       Ab
 I'll follow you on and on and on and on, all along your setting sun
   Db        
 A passenger


Chorus:
Eb          Fm                  Ab
 My teasing mime, you're losing soul
        Eb             Fm
 My monument of cannel coal
     Eb      Ab             Fm
 We fit like crime and criminal
         Eb              Db
 I stay shelter, not a home
         
 Not a home

Eb          Fm                  Ab
 My teasing mime, you're losing soul
        Eb             Fm
 My monument of cannel coal
     Eb      Ab             Fm
 We fit like crime and criminal
  Eb             
 Ohh
 
           Fm                Ab
 My little mime, you're all alone
         Eb               Fm
 Telling stories of long ago
                     Ab             Fm
 We used to fit like crime and criminal
                 Cb
 But I was just shelter 

Eb
