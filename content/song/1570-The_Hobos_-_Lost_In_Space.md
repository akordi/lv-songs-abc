The Hobos - Lost in space

Welcome to worlwide weblines,
please fasten the body scan belt and draw your attention 
to the hologram map to your right and type your destination,
warning, we are not responsible for losing your body information,
you may end up forever lost in space, and remember,
we can not stop your thinking.

Em                   D          C
Between the shelters from the delight
Em                  D          Em
Among the stars and black cold night
Em                   D           C
You're trembling and losing your mind
       G       D
You're lost in space
       G       D
You're lost in space

Refrain:
Em      D           Em   C
Hey now you got the last chance
Em     D      C
Fade out fade out
Em      D         Em
Far out up in the sky
C    G
High high

    Em      D     Em
You have to stay alive
   Em               G         D 
We want you to come back from high
Em           D   C
Back to the same world 
       G    D
Out of space 
          G
...out of space

Refrain
