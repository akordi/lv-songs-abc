(1)
It's a daylight
Another night
Why there is people talking?
Can you help me?
Find the way

(2)
I feel the sun
But i can't see it
The curtain is closed 
All my life
Do you see the same 
picture as me ?

I can't hold on another day

(3)
Can you help me?
Pass the street
I hope i will remember
Your face...mmm

(4)
I chase the rainbows
Across my mind
Have you heard of rain?
That will be tonight
Please take me home
Where i belong

(piedz)
I'm a blindman 
Searching for love
I'm a blindman
Looking at the black sky
Uh
I'm a nice guy 
Under your hand

Just a young man
Falling in love
Hoping to find a love
Without looking
Another feel of life
I can't replace

I can't hold on another day
No more
