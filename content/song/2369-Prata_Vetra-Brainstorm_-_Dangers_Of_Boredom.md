Em          G
Show me the place
Em          G
Give me the reason 
G
I’ll find the way 
Em
But I wont come too close 
Em      G
7 p.m. 
                       Em G
At your favorite corner 
G
I’ll have a plan 
    Em                   G
And we see where it goes
Em
Oh, lord
     G
Would you lend me some words 
C
She’s got the melody 
Am
And I’ll bring the thirds 
Em          G
All that we want is to sing 
C                    Am
Love is a meaning of everything
Em               G  
Let’s hide on the trains 
Em                  G
And in the flats of strangers 
G
Dangers of boredom 
      Em
Could eat us alive 
A
Lets dive into the sky 
    Em
And move all the mountains 
A
Lets share the music 
G
Night and day
```
