Everything is so beautiful
That’s what makes it so grateful
That’s what makes it so grateful
Here’s different from somewhere else
To return is our only wish, that’s all we want

We can talk in other languages
We can see a golden sun
Playing in the most blue sky
Playing in the most blue sky
This is our Amberland, the only Amberland

We will win if we are all together
We will love
We will win if we care for each other
And only love shall rule the world

We will win if we are all together
We will love
We will win if we care for each other
And only love shall rule

We see the same stars as everybody
We breathe the same air
We breathe the same air
We are the same as everybody, everybody
But, listen, there is one thing what changes everything

We will come back to love you more
And watch your color sunsets
Lying back in the sand with your hand in my hand
In our only Amberland and we’ll have everything

We will win if we are all together
We will love
We will win if we care for each other
And only love shall rule the world

We live in a small country
(In a beautiful country)
Yes, it’s small but full of love
(Full of passion and hope, full of passion and hope)
(Full of passion and hope)

We will win if we are all together
We will love
We will win if we care for each other
And only love shall rule the world

We will win if we are all together
We will love
We will win if we care for each other
And only love shall rule the world

We will win if we are all together
