You stuck in my head
I found you on sale,
Hello!
 
The dress of my dreams
And five pairs of jeans
So cheap...
 
But how could you make it,
Why would I care?
I guess all my dresses
Are made of thin air.
 
T-shirts,
In all the colors
Need more
What will I wear next summer.
T-shirts,
For just one dollar
Need more,
Fantasize,
Hey, next season time to buy.
 
You hug me at night,
Po-polyester, oh yeah!
 
But little I know,
You are someoneâ€™s income, too far,
 
Because you are
So so so pretty,
Give give give me...
 
But how could you make it,
Why would I care?
I guess all my dresses
Are made of thin air.
 
T-shirts,
In all the colors
Need more
What will I wear next summer.
T-shirts,
For just one dollar
Need more,
Fantasize,
Hey, next season time to buy.
 
T-shirts, t-shirts, t-shirts
Need more,
Fantasize,
Hey, next season time to buy.
 
(Time to buy)
So pretty!
(Time to buy)
No pity!
(Time to buy)
So stuck in my head!
(Time to buy)
Hey, next season time to buy.
 
T-shirts,
In all the colors
Need more
What will I wear next summer.
T-shirts,
For just one dollar
Need more,
Fantasize,
Hey, next season time to buy.
 
T-shirts, t-shirts, t-shirts,
Need more,
Fantasize,
Hey, next season time to buy.
