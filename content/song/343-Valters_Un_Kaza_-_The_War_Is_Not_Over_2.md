C C9 C Em Em7 Em Am
I slowly walk into the night arround
F Dm Dm7 G
To see how dreams of people die
C C9 C Em Em7 Em Am
They gently fall from windows all around
F Dm
And crash against the ground like glass
Em C Em Am
And I'm so sorry I'm so helpless in this angry world
F Dm Dm7 G
If only I could change it for one day


Refrain

F Am
The war is not over everyone knows it
Bb G
It's just a reason to make us believe
F Am
That someone is loser someone is winner
Bb G
To make us believe that's the way it should be
F Dm Dm7 C
But I don't wanna believe



In the story they all tell this fairytale has gone to far
I take a step and dare myself to be free
To see how beautiful we are that everyone can be a star
If only we would start believe in dreams
Believe in who we are


Refrain
The war is not over everyone knows it
It's just a reason to make us believe
That someone is loser someone is winner
To make us believe that's the way it should be
But I don't wanna believe

But I don't wanna believe, no, no, no

But I don't wanna believe
