You can play with your life
And I will watch from above
But don’t forget to go crazy

Every time when we meet
You act so cool and so sweet
But I don’t know what is inside ya

Where you go, where you sleep
I forgot I don’t give a shit
‘Cause it’s time to realise
That you should quit

Oh, I woke up in a new day, yeah
And now I’m sure I won’t stay, yeah
My happiness awaits me, yeah
I’m ready for the great changes

I woke up in a new day
And now I’m sure I won’t stay, yeah
My happiness awaits me, yeah
I’m ready for the great changes, oh

It’s so good to be free
I was right, please agree
None of us should feel the sadness

Now you don’t act so loud
Now you don’t seem so proud
I’m so glad you stopped this madness

Where you go, where you sleep
I forgot I don’t give a shit
‘Cause it’s time to realise
That you should quit

Oh, I woke up in a new day, yeah
And now I’m sure I won’t stay, yeah
My happiness awaits me, yeah
I’m ready for the great changes

I woke up in a new day
And now I’m sure I won’t stay, yeah
My happiness awaits me, yeah
I’m ready for the great changes, oh

I woke up in a new day
And now I’m sure I won’t stay
My happiness awaits me
I’m ready for the changes

I woke up in a new day
And now I’m sure I won’t stay
My happiness awaits me
I’m ready for the great changes

I woke up in a new day
And now I’m sure I won’t stay, yeah
My happiness awaits me, yeah
I’m ready for the great changes, oh
