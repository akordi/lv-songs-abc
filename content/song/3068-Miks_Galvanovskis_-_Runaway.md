```text
Give me a kiss on my lips and say the words right
Just say the truth, that you want to stay with me tonight
I wanna dance, don’t wanna play another game
Oh babe, what do you say if we just run away?

Let’s run away baby, let’s run away tonight
You just need to believe and throw your memories behind
Let’s run away baby, you are my light
I know with you I can find escape from my darkest night

Oh, take my hand, take my clothes
Take my heart, take my skin and bones
Oh, take my mind, I don’t need it anymore
I am lost, I have found my head is spinning round
Oh, just be quiet and don’t make a sound

Let’s run away baby, let’s run away tonight
You just need to believe and throw your memories behind
Let’s run away baby, you are my light
I know with you I can find escape from my darkest night

Give me a kiss, say good night
I wanna dance, you wanna love, I feel fight
Give me a kiss, say good night
I wanna dance, you wanna love, I feel fight

Let’s run away baby, let’s run away tonight
You just need to believe and throw your memories behind
Let’s run away baby, you are my light
I know with you I can find escape from my darkest night

Let’s run away baby, let’s run away tonight
You just need to believe and throw your memories behind
Let’s run away baby, you are my light
I know with you I can find escape from my darkest night
