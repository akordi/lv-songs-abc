```text
Stop for the silence
And take a deep breath
And take a deep breath

Be yourself for every moment
And be who you are
And be who you are

No matter where you going
Follow your dreams
Try to chase them
Try to chase them

You and I, you and I
Together we make it
Together we make it

You and I, you and I
Together we make it
Together we make it

Stop for the silence
And take a deep breath
And take a deep breath

Be yourself for every moment
And be who you are
And be who you are

It might not be easy
Just stay for it
And do your best
Do your best

You and I, you and I
Together we make it
Together we make it

You and I, you and I
Together we make it
Together we make it

Oh… (Together we make it)
Oh, together we make it
Together we make it (Together we make it)

Ooh… (Together we make it)
Together we make it
Together we make it

You and I, you and I
Together we make it
Together we make it

You and I, you and I
Together we make it
Together we make it
