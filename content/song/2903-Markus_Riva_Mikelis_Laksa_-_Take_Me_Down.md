Tell me how it feels to be gone
Disappear for days
Tell me how it feels to be high
In such a low low place

I walk in the shadows of love I, I
Walk in the shadows of love
I’ll tell you how it feels
To be caught in your tidalwave

(Ooohh)I can`t ignore it I
Can`t ignore it I
I can`t ignore it I 

If you gon` fall, if you gon` break
Darling I’m coming with you
All of your faults, all of your mistakes
Baby I’ll make `em with you
And if your feet do hit the ground
If you sink and drown
Take me down

Down into the depths of your mind
Where the monsters lie
Let me meet the demons inside
They don’t have to hide

I walk in the shadows of love I, I
Forever be your shadow of love
I’ll hold you through the dark
Of the night til you turn on the light

(Ooohh)I cannot ignore it I
Cannot ignore it I
I cannot ignore it I 

If you gon` fall, if you gon` break
Darling I’m coming with you
All of your faults, all of your mistakes
Baby I’ll make `em with you
And if your feet do hit the ground
If you sink and drown
Take me down,
Take me down

If we go up in flames
I won`t feel a thing
Your love just numbs the pain
Your love just numbs the pain
That’s shooting up my veins
My heartbeat starts to fade
Next to you I’ll stay
Even if it kills me

(Ooohh)I can`t ignore it I
Can`t ignore it I
I can`t ignore it I 

If you gon` fall, if you gon` break
Darling I’m coming with you
All of your faults, all of your mistakes
Baby I’ll make `em with you
And if your feet do hit the ground
If you sink and drown
Take me down,
Take me down
