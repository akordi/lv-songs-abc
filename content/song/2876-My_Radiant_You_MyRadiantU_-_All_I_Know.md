```text
[C] I Left my home on a Sunday
Hear the church bells ringing
[Am] Got in my car started driving
Driving till the end of road

[C] I'll send my love to you baby 
From a thousand miles away
[Am] It's like the water is rising
And sky's about to break

  All I [C] know You made me for a [Am] reason
  All I [F] know I find myself on my [G] knees again
  And now you want me to [C] stay
  I know you want me to [Am] stay

Hey, hey!
[C] I set out on a venture
In a search for better life
[Am] Just to find my self-broken
With a longing deep inside

[C] And I don't know how the winds will blow
Or when it will be my time 
[Am] But I just know I'm my father's son
And I'm glad to be alive

  All I [C] know You made me for a [Am] reason
  All I [F] know I find myself on my [G] knees again
  All I [C] know You made me for a [Am] reason
  All I [F] know I, all I [G] know

And it [C] won't be long
Till I enter home
And it [Am] won't be long
Till you sit me at the table [F][G]

  All I [C] know You made me for a [Am] reason
  All I [F] know I find myself on my [G] knees again
  All I [C] know You made me for a [Am] reason
  All I [F] know I, all I [G] know
  And now I'm going to [C] stay
  Yea, I'm going to stay
