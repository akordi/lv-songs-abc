```text
Fast cars empty eyes
Bigger better not enough
You think you’re cool but you’re all the same

Cause when the world get’s filled with lies
You gotta keep your head up high
Always gonna change your mind
Never bring me down

  You gotta go and make them wonder
  To save yourself to going under
  Never forget your heart is where you are
  Never stop from going faster
  You don’t know what we’re chasing after
  A silhouette from the otherside

Breathe in breathe out
Seeing everything
That is left to find
You better pick those pieces up
You tell me what you want
And you say you gonna move
Never seem to go
With all the shit you’re going through
You’re see the time and it’s passing by

Cause when the world get’s filled with lies
You gotta keep your head up high
Always gonna change your mind
Never bring me down

  You gotta go and make them wonder
  To save yourself to going under
  Never forget your heart is where you are
  Never stop from going faster
  You don’t know what we’re chasing after
  A silhouette from the otherside

Lerned to live a lie
Promised glory life
Made for you and i
Trust those words inside

It’s a silhouette
a silhouette
