```text
She’s like a girl from the scene 
I’m seein' in my dreams 
Shining in majesty 
She put her spell on me    
I am just a guy she've never seen 
Confused and lost in my daydream 
So fast and imperceptibly  
She charmed me easily  
She’s walking over me 
I’m seeking words to speak 
My mind plays tricks on me    
I can see my destiny  
If I’m too shy or weak 
Time leaves me in misery  
I want you to come with me 
I know we’re meant to be 
My cards are plain to see 
Yeah, you are my fantasy  
I want you to be with me 
Let’s unite in harmony 
Cause you’re livin' in my dreams  
Yeah, you are my ecstasy
