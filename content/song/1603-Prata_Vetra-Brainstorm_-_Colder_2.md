Bm                         Em              F#m 
come, oh, come early i’m afraid of getting colder, colder
Bm                        Em             F#m           Em Em D A
keep the night burning to shine our love always, always

Bm                          
pictures on the wall her pictures on my wall
            A             G      
she’s so beautiful, so beautiful
 Bm                          
climbing up to fall i’m climbing up to fall
           A                 G      
i’m still staying cool, i’m staying cool
Bm                              G            
 one day i’ll find you just to prove that i’m real
       A                 D               /D/C# 
out of love and hate, of love and hate
Bm                           G   
 and losing ties with common sense, baby, i know
       A                 F# 
i will make a bridge to place where my mind goes

Bm                         Em              F#m 
come, oh, come early i’m afraid of getting colder, colder
Bm                        Em             F#m 
keep the night burning to shine our love always, always

Bm                          
thousands of the walls 8 billions of the walls
            A             G      
she’s so beautiful, so beautiful
Bm                          
digi-dogs around her digi-dogs around
           A                       G      
i’m still staying cool, well, i’m staying cool
Bm                         G            
 i’m losing all i have and all i ever will
       A                 D               /D/C# 
out of love and hate, of love and hate
Bm                          G   
 i’m losing daydreams and a good night sleep
    A                  F# 
oh, baby, our passions are hiding deep
 
Bm                         Em              F#m 
come, oh, come early i’m afraid of getting colder, colder
Bm                        Em             F#m 
keep the night burning to shine our love always, always
