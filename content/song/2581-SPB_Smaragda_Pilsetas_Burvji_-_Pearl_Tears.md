```text
[C] Her tears are like a [E] pearls
That's falls from her [Am] eyes
Every [F] time, every time she cries, cries, [C] cries

[C] And deserts she walks [E] through
Turn into [Am] green, turn into green
She must be an [F] angel (She must be an angel)
An angel for me

  [F] She is so wrong, she is so [G] right
  I wish that she could be mine
  [C] Just my angel, [Am] just my angel...

  [F] She is so wrong, she is so [G] right
  I wish that she could be mine
  [C] Just my angel, [Am] just my angel...

[C] And when I closed my [E] eyes
I felt her all [Am] around
It seemed enough, [F] enough
But there was more to [C] find

Those [C] words she said to [E] me
Were filled with a pleasant [Am] voice
I knew this dream wouldn't [F]last
But still, this is my choice

  [F] She is so wrong, she is so [G] right
  I wish that she could be mine
  [C] Just my angel, [Am] just my angel...

  [F] She is so wrong, she is so [G] right
  I wish that she could be mine
  [C] Just my angel, [Am] just my angel...
