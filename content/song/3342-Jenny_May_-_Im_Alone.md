I’m alone, I’m alone, I’m alone, I’m alone, I’m alone
I’m alone, I’m alone, I’m alone, I’m alone, I’m alone

Lost in the city, in the city, in the city tonight, ah ah oh
The lights are pretty in the city, in the city tonight, ah ah oh
Everybody’s got somewhere to rush to
I just wish I had you here tonight

I’m alone, I’m alone, I’m a lonely girl who’s coming back to you
Down that track to you on the midnight train
I’m alone, I’m alone, I’m a lonely girl who’s coming back to you
On the train through the rain to your heart

I really miss you, really miss you, really miss you tonight, ah ah oh
I wanna kiss you, wanna kiss you, wanna kiss you tonight, ah ah oh
Party people seem to stop and stare
But I don’t really care, I walk on by

I’m alone, I’m alone, I’m a lonely girl who’s coming back to you
Down that track to you on the midnight train
I’m alone, I’m alone, I’m a lonely girl who’s coming back to you
On the train through the rain to your heart
I believe we can make a new start

I’m alone, I’m alone, I’m a lonely girl who’s coming back to you
Down that track to you on the midnight train
I’m alone, I’m alone, I’m a lonely girl who’s coming back to you
On the train through the rain to your heart
I believe we can make a new start
