O-o-o-o-o-oh, o-o-o-o-o-o-oh, o-o-o-o-o-oh,
No, I’m not late, 
No, I’m not late,
No, I’m not late.

Sunlight in your eyes,
Stars shine in your hair, 
Moonlight shines on you,
So mine now is your heart.

Cars fast memories,
Reaches the top of possibilities,
Mountains get high,
So I can reach the star.

Leaves fall on the road,
You are in the red coat, 
Steps will find the way,
No, I’m not late. 

O-o-o-o-o-oh, o-o-o-o-o-o-oh, o-o-o-o-o-oh,
No, I’m not late.

Dreams come true sometimes,
Nothing comes for free,
But you still believe,
‘Cause life is what you like.

If I can reach the star…
If I can reach the star…

Leaves fall on the road,
You are in the red coat, 
Steps will find the way,
No, I’m not late.
Leaves fall on the road,
You are in the red coat, 
Steps will find the way,
No, I’m not late.

O-o-o-o-o-oh, o-o-o-o-o-o-oh, o-o-o-o-o-oh,
No, I’m not late.
O-o-o-o-o-oh, o-o-o-o-o-o-oh, o-o-o-o-o-oh,
No, I’m not late.
