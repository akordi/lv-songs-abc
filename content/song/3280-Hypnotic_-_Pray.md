So I’m just sitting here and thinking
What’s happening with the world alone
What’s going on with the whole world
I decided to write a song

I hope you will listen
These words which are coming from my own heart
And I don’t care what is your nation
You are a human like me and that’s all

What am I supposed to do
That’s enough, we must love each other

I will pray, pray for a better day
Pray for the future

So I’m just sitting here and watching
How many people are dying
And I wish they were living (Living)
In this brightful future

I hope you’ll be listening
These words which are coming from my own heart
And I don’t care what is your nation (Nation)
You are a human like me and that’s all

What am I supposed to do
That’s enough, we must love each other

I will pray, pray for a better day
Pray for the future, stop the war
I will pray, pray for a better day
Pray for the future, stop the war

You are a human like me
Human, human, you are a human
Human like, human like, human like
Pray, pray, pray, pray

I will pray, pray for a better day
Pray for the future, stop the war
I will pray, pray for a better day
Pray for the future, stop the war (Stop the war)

I will pray, pray for a better day
Pray for the future, stop the war
I will pray, pray for a better day
Pray for the future, stop the war
