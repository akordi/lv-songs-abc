Something 'bout the midnight sky, yeah
And when I get that liquor in my body
Everything's just fading away
Fading away, fading away
 
Might be a safe place for my body
But my soul is suffering in it
Slowly getting faded away
Faded away, fade away
 
Sometimes I think it's just 'make believe'
Do we really think this is how we should be?
 
When it all falls, will we fall at all?
 
Something 'bout the way I'm feeling
Have I really reached the ceiling?
Feeling like there's nothing for me
Nothing for me, nothing for me
 
Nothing is as good as it seems
Getting tired of all these false dreams
Have they really faded away
Faded away, faded away
 
When it all falls, will we fall at all?
When it all falls, will we fall at all?
 
(Want to live in truth, how about we change up?)
Don't you think that it's time that we change up?
(Want to live in truth, how about we change up?)
Can't stay away, it's not too late
 
(Want to live in truth, how about we change up?)
There is a reason why it's getting closer
(Want to live in truth, how about we change up?)
It's getting closer
 
When it all falls, will we fall at all?
When it all falls, will we fall at all?
 
When it all falls, will we fall at all?
Want to live in truth, how about we let loose?
Don't you think it's time to change up?
 
When it all falls, will we fall at all?
Want to live in truth, how about we let loose?
Don't you think it's time to change up?
