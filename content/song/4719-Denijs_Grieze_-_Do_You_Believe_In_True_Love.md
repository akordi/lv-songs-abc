C(add9)                      G
Long afternoon walks by the beach
C(add9)                         G
Long, long talks about an hour each
C(add9)                    G
Driving my bike down your street
C(add9)                                G
Hoping to see you, hope that we would meet

C(add9)
Think of how many things we've been through
G
And how many places we've been to
C(add9)                                             G
And that time when we shared our first kiss on that roof
I told you

piedz.
C(add9)            G
Darling I have one question for you
         Em7           D
Do you believe in love that is true
C(add9)                   G
The type of love that our grandparents knew
           Em7         D
When every day again I fall in love with you

About a million texts we have sent
Every time I go home, I can feel your scent
Looking through old photographs, we look so cute
We've got to fix this because I'm not me without you

Think of how many things we've been through
And how many places we've been to
And that time when we shared our first kiss on that roof
I told you 

piedz.2x
Darling I have one question for you
Do you believe in love that is true
The type of love that our grandparents knew
When every day again I fall in love with you 

I know you've made your decision to cut me out of your life 
But baby please, please think again
Cuz you are my religion and noone can't deny it
So please I can't stand this pain
I just wanted to ask

piedz.3x
Darling I have one question for you
Do you believe in love that is true
The type of love that our grandparents knew
When every day again I fall in love with you
