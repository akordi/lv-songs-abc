```text
When the amber sea sounds a call,
I send for you my little dream ball,
I want to see you always behind,
My luck haunts the back of my mind.

I will give you license for love,
I hope you to look in my life,
To tempt you more and more in every way,
This is my true red-letter day.

I will give you license for love,
I will give you reason to live,
When amber sun goes down, down on me,
This land is meant for you and me.

Come dancing to my land,
All night together hand in hand,
I need you here by me, by me,
At my nice, wonder amber sea.

Come dancing to my land,
All night together hand in hand,
I need you here by me, by me,
At my nice, wonder amber sea.

I am a sunlight amber girl,
My clear eyes are deep as a well,
I’m happy as the day; the day is so long,
I will sing you an amber song.

I will give you license for love,
I hope you to look in my life,
To tempt you more and more in every way,
This is my true red-letter day.

Come dancing to my land,
All night together hand in hand,
I need you here by me, by me,
At my nice, wonder amber sea.

Come dancing to my land,
All night together hand in hand,
I need you here by me, by me,
At my nice, wonder amber sea.

Come dancing to my land,
All night together hand in hand,
I need you here by me, by me,
At my nice, wonder amber sea.

Come dancing to my land,
All night together hand in hand,
I need you here by me, by me,
At my nice, wonder amber sea.
