1.
In my life I knew a boy, he fell right into my heart
Light was shining from his eyes, cause he was pure gold inside,
I mean, I think I knew
What this life was all about until he crushed into my world
And now I never ever wanna let go this little piece of paradise

Chorus
You bring the best in me
Bring out the best in me,
All the things that rest in me

2.
Boy, there was darkness all around me until I saw your pretty face, yeah
My mama told me I should know that there are things in life that never ever change,
Like when he holds me in his arms I feel the saints are coming down,
He’s  divine in every way, and he’s mine in every way

No no no, Now I never ever wanna let go

It is easy to say, I am yours in every way, I believe that we could try
It is needless to say, I am yours in every way, I believe that we could try﻿
