Intro: C C F F x2

Vers1:
C               Em             Am
I slowly walk into the night around
           Dm               G
To see how dreams of people die
      C               Em            Am
They gently fall from windows all around
           Dm                      G
And crash against the ground like glass
G          C     E      Am               F
And I'm so sorry I'm so helpless in this angry world
                Dm                G
If only I could change it for one day

Refrain:
               F             Am
The war is not over everyone knows it
            Bb                 G
It's just a reason to make us believe
                   F                   Am
That someone's the loser someone's the winner
           Bb                               G
To make us believe that's the way it should be
F                  C
But I don't wanna believe

Vers2:
In the story they all tell this fairytale has gone to far
I take a step and dare myself to be free
To see how beautiful we are that everyone can be a star
If only we would start believe in dreams
Believe in who we are

Refrain

Outro: C C F F x2 then C
