Oh oh iyeah iyeah
Oh oh iyeah iyeah
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Cause what I say is what I mean (oh, oh)
I'm rising up from the deep sea
I know I have it in me

I wanna be who I really wanna be, be
I wanna live just the way I wanna live live
And all I really wanna do
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm gonna walk the walk
Gonna talk the talk (Oh oh)
Stand up proud and say it out loud
Wanna take control and run the show
Gonna walk, walk, walk
Gonna walk the talk

Walk the walk
Gonna talk the talk (Oh oh)
Stand up proud and say it out loud
Wanna take control and run the show
Gonna walk, walk, walk
Gonna walk the talk

Iyeah iyeah 
Iyeah iyeah

I’m gonna keep my head high
And time will only make me stronger (Oh, oh)
I always put on a smile
You know I go that extra mile

I wanna be who I really wanna be, be
I wanna live just the way I wanna live live
And all I really wanna do
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm gonna walk the walk
Gonna talk the talk (Oh oh)
Stand up proud and say it out loud
Wanna take control and run the show
Gonna walk, walk, walk
Gonna walk the talk

Walk the walk
Gonna talk the talk (Oh oh)
Stand up proud and say it out loud
Wanna take control and run the show
Gonna walk, walk, walk
Gonna walk the talk
