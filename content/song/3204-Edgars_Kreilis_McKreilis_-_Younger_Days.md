If I have to go away
Then this time I never will look back
That's how I remember fights
Ending over middle of the night

There was only me and my sister
We both tried to escape
Burning through our fears,
But they won't ever get the picture
Of what we tried to explain
What we had to face

Younger days!
When you knock on door
Who cares it's 8:00 AM, A?!
Are you coming out to play?
Younger days
When the playground was the place
Where meet a friends. A?!
Hey who else is going in?
Younger days!
Younger days!
Younger days!
Younger days!

If I have to go that way
Will you stay and cover up my back?
That’s how I remember us
Going down where
Others couldn’t find

There was only me and my sister
We both tried to escape
Burning through our fears,
But they won't ever get the picture
Of what we tried to explain
What we had to face

Younger days!
When you knock on door
Who cares it's 8:00 AM, A?!
Are you coming out to play?
Younger days
When the playground was the place
Where meet a friends. A?!
Hey who else is going in?
Younger days!
Younger days!
Younger days!
Younger days!

Oh, oh! I know!
All the troubles I faced younger
Created who I am
All those feelings felt like hell, but
It doesn’t burn us then.
Stop the blame you give to your past
You got to understand,
Cause you are who you,
You are who you was younger days!

Younger days!
Younger days!
Younger days!
Younger days!

Oh, oh! I know!
Younger days!
Younger days!
We’re going back to
Younger days!
Younger days!
Oh, oh! I know!
