PIEDZ || Bm | Bm | D | D | A | A | Bm | Bm ||

it's like a thunder without rain
or like a week without sunday
or like a book without a last page
you want to buy you have to pay

PANTS || Em | Em | G | G | D | D | A | A ||

a storm without pain
without any distruction
it's a good old game
million pleasures but no satisfaction
storm takes your desires
and all expectations
it would happen anyway
it's the only way to lose your frustration

PIEDZ || Bm | Bm | D | D | A | A | Bm | Bm ||

it's like a thunder without rain
or like a week without sunday
or like a book without a last page
you want to buy you have to pay
and you can feel without a touch
and you can hear without speakers
of course you'll see without tv
and we will run without sneakers

red, red sky
and atlantes are swimming by
the same mistakes
different time and different place

PIEDZ || Bm | Bm | D | D | A | A | Bm | Bm ||

it's like a thunder without rain
or like a week without sunday
or like a book without a last page
you want to buy you have to pay
and you can feel without a touch
and you can hear without speakers
of course you'll see without tv
and we will run without sneakers

STARPSPĒLE || Bm | E | Bm | E ||

NOBEIGUMS || Bm | E | Bm | E ||
one song is over another one left
the more you know, the more you know
you try to forget
heaven and earth

|| Bm | Bm | D | D | A | A | Bm | Bm ||

there will be no winner
as we all are saints
and we are, we are such sinners

PIEDZ || Bm | Bm | D | D | A | A | Bm | Bm ||

it's like a thunder without rain
or like a week without sunday
or like a book without a last page
you want to buy you have to pay

PIEDZ || Bm | Bm | D | D | A | A | Bm | Bm ||

and you can feel without a touch
and you will feel without speakers
of course you'll see without tv
and we will run without sneakers
