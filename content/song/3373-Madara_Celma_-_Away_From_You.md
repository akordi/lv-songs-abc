```text
I wish I could runaway from you
Like a bird in the sky and feel nothing for you
But as days go by, on and on somehow
My soul is still waiting for you
Oh, my soul is still waiting for you

I wish I could runaway from you
Like a bird in the sky and feel nothing for you
But as days go by, on and on somehow
My soul is still waiting for you
Oh, my soul is still waiting for you

Promises broken and words left unspoken
But with sorrow my life goes so wrong
Do you miss me? Do you think of me at all?
I keep asking myself – what did I do wrong?
I keep asking myself – what did I do wrong?

I wish I could hide away from you
Like a sun in the clouds and do nothing for you
But as days go by, on and on somehow
My heart is still crying for you
Oh, my heart is still crying for you

Promises broken and words left unspoken
But with sorrow my life goes so wrong
Do you miss me? Do you think of me at all?
I keep asking myself – what did I do wrong?
I keep asking myself – what did I do wrong?

Promises broken and words left unspoken
But with sorrow my life goes so wrong (My life so wrong)
Do you miss me? Do you think of me at all?
I keep asking myself – what did I do wrong?
I keep asking myself – what did I do wrong?
