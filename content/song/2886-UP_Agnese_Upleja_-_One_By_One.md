```text
I [Am] took a horse to the [F] water
I [Am] rode that [F] high horse but [G] you flogged it [Am] down
[F] Slap slap [G] you’re [Am] on
You [Am] brought a knife to a [F] fist fight
You [Am] brought a [F] knife but [G] I pulled out a [Am] gun
[F] Bang bang [G] you’re [Am] done!

  [F] One by [G] one by [C] one by [Am] one
  I will [F] chase you [G] down one by [Am] one
  [F] One by [G] one by [C] one by [Am] one
  I’m gonna [F] run you [G] down one by [Am] one

I helped you up from the ashes
I picked you up from the dust
But you sneaked a gun into my mouth
And we’re struck by the words that came out
But you sneaked a gun into my mouth
And we’re struck by the words that came out

  [F] One by [G] one by [C] one by [Am] one
  I will [F] chase you [G] down one by [Am] one
  [F] One by [G] one by [C] one by [Am] one
  I’m gonna [F] run you [G] down one by [Am] one

[F] Beggars can’t be [G] choosers 
[C] Cheaters will be [Am] losers 
 I will [F] cut you [G] down one by [Am] one
