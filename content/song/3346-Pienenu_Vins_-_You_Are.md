```text
Your everlasting love is happiness for me
I thank the mighty Lord for that he made me see
To see that you are only one that makes me smile
To understand that this is for a very long time you’re mine

You are the most precious thing I ever had
You are the one that makes me feel so glad
You are the one that makes me feel alive
You are, you are, you are

My life is different since I met you that day
I thank the mighty Lord for showing me the way
The way to get to you and now I’m full with light
Forget about the troubles and just be with me tonight

You are the most precious thing I ever had
You are the one that makes me feel so glad
You are the one that makes me feel alive
You are, you are, you are

You are the most precious thing I ever had
You are the one that makes me feel so glad
You are the one that makes me feel alive
You are, you are, you are
