```text
On and on all my mornings stay the same
A cup of tea gently warming up my hands
The day goes by slowly as it always does
I could pretend I’m still the same though I am not

It’s not the way I do my hair or what I wear
You couldn’t tell but in my eyes, there is a spark
Lights up the dark, wasn’t there before I’m so much more
But if you ask the mirror couldn’t tell

You came on tiptoe, tiptoe
And snuck into my heart
On tiptoe, tiptoe
On tiptoe, so slow

And snuck into my heart
On tiptoe, so slow
And snuck into my heart
On tiptoe

Just a day like any other wakin’ up at 6 AM
I’m out the door before you’re up
More of the same, the beat, it never seems to change
Unlike today you’ve got me wishing I could stay

You came on tiptoe, tiptoe
And snuck into my heart
On tiptoe, tiptoe
On tiptoe, so slow, on tiptoe

And snuck into my heart
On tiptoe, so slow
And snuck into my heart

I never knew I was hiding
Until you came and found me
Never knew I was hiding
Never knew I was hiding

You snuck in, snuck into my heart
On tiptoe, oh, so slow
You snuck in, snuck into my heart
You snuck in, oh, you snuck in on tiptoe

On tiptoe
