[Verse 1]
Don't say a word
Hear your heart
Feel the life running through you
Here we are standing still
You make a feel so much harder

[Chorus]
Beaten down, ripped out
Broken million times
Fell in love, felt pain
Things will never feel the same
When things makes sense, the world breaks down
But in the end it's love, we're fine and full
All we have burned down
You don't know how it hurts
Fell in love, felt pain
Things will never feel the same
But in the end, it's all worth fighting for


[Verse 2]
Close your eyes
Take a breath
Feel the love running through you
Here we are moving fast
You make a feel so much harder

[Chorus]
Beaten down, ripped out
Broken million times
Fell in love, felt pain
Things will never feel the same
When things makes sense, the world breaks down
But in the end it's love, we're fine and full
All we have burned down
You don't know how it hurts
Fell in love, felt pain
Things will never feel the same
But in the end, it's all worth fighting for

[Break]
(Ah-ah-ah)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
Beaten down, ripped out
Broken million times
Fell in love, felt pain
Things will never feel the same
When things makes sense, the world breaks down
But in the end it's love, we're fine and full
All we have burned down
You don't know how it hurts
Fell in love, felt pain
Things will never feel the same
But in the end, it's all worth fighting for
