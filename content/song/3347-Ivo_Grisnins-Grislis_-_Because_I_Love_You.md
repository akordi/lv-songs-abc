```text
If somebody gave me a million, I’d give a second half of it to you
My mind changes like a chameleon and that’s the way I do
But I love you in the way I do

If I could write a really nice poem I would dedicate it to you
Women can’t live without them and that’s the way they do
But I love you in the way I do
Because I love you in the way I do

If I would be a perfect person I wouldn’t be interesting for you
Because no one in this world is perfect, not they, not me nor you
And you love me in the way you do
And I love you in the way I do

And I love you in the way I do
And you love me in the way you do
And I love you in the way I do
