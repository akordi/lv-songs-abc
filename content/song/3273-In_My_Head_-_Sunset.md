```text
I could take myself anywhere
I won’t
I can break this dice
And take off the earth

I’m going through the night
Alone to face
I’m going through the dust
To make you believe

I can trust myself
I can run through the sunset
You can rush to find me far
This time, this time

I’m restricted to you
Going anywhere you want
You call it paradise
I don’t believe

I can trust myself
I can run through the sunset
You can rush to find me far
This time, this time

I can trust myself
I can run through the sunset
You can rush to find me far
This time, this time

I can trust myself
I can trust myself
I can trust myself
I can trust myself

I can trust myself
I can run through the sunset
You can rush to find me far
This time, this time

I can trust myself
I can run through the sunset
You can rush to find me far
This time is mine
