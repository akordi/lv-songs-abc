There is something new that I want
Turns out I’m part of your heart
Now I want to know your will
I strive to make the heaven so real

Your breath is in me, from now I can breathe
You destroyed every darkness in my broken heart
Your love burns inside, I can’t hold, it breaks out
It’s time to surrender and cry out to creator

It was so sad and I didn’t expect
Your breath becomes sweeping like wind around me
Then I saw your hand and you show me the way
And now I’m here, I’m standing here

Your breath is in me, from now I can breathe
You destroyed every darkness in my broken heart
Your love burns inside, I can’t hold, it breaks out
It’s time to surrender and cry out to creator

Your breath is in me, from now I can breathe
You destroyed every darkness in my broken heart
Your love burns inside, I can’t hold, it breaks out
It’s time to surrender before king of majesty

Your breath is in me, oh…
Hey… oh…

There is something new that I want
Turns out we’re part of your heart
