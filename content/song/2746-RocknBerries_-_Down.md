```text
I was lost in the river 
And the river was your love 
They say I am a criminal 
For steeling your taken heart 
But I don’t give up!  
Ooh, I just want to be with you, babe 
Even when the sun goes down 
I just want to be with you, darling 
Even when the world goes down 
Down, down, down...  
I was lost in the moonlight 
And the moonlight was your heart 
They can track me down they can shot me down 
But the love will stay on the spot 
Cause I won’t give it up!  
Ooh, I just want to be with you, babe 
Even when the sun goes down 
I just want to be with you, darling 
Even when the world goes down 
Down, down, down...
