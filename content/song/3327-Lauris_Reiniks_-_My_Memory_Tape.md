```text
I don’t wanna have another day that would make me stay
I’d better run away
I’m sick of regularity and triviality
You can call me a refugee

Don’t wanna have another smile
Oh, baby, if it’s just for a while
I’m tired of this mystery and lack of honesty
And life of probability, yeah, yeah, yeah!

When we met I didn’t get
That I would hear this crazy threat
I’m no fool you can rule
My self-esteem, it screams:
“Oh, you don’t realize
She wouldn’t go for compromise”
And I try to escape
To delete my memory tape

I was never gonna say to you what I am now up to
I never thought of that before
I’ve never been so pliable and reliable
But, girl, you wanted more

You wanted me to be you man
But you never tried to understand
I’m tired of this mystery and lack of honesty
And life of probability, yeah, yeah, yeah!

When we met I didn’t get
That I would hear this crazy threat
I’m no fool you can rule
My self-esteem, it screams:
“Oh, you don’t realize
She wouldn’t go for compromise”
And I try to escape
To delete my memory tape

When we met I didn’t get
I’m no fool you can rule
You don’t realize
You wouldn’t go for compromise
And I try to escape
To delete my memory tape

When we met I didn’t get
That I would hear this crazy threat
I’m no fool you can rule,
My self-esteem, it screams:
“Oh, you don’t realize,
She wouldn’t go for compromise”.
And I try to escape
To delete my memory tape

(Ohohoho, ohohoho!)
To delete my memory tape
(Ohohoho, ohohoho!)
To delete my memory tape
