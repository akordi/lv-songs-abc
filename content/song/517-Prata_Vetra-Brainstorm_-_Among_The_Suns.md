  C               G
I may seem wise I may seem old
F                 Em             Am    F G
Feels like I just came into this world
  C               G
I beg and lie and then regret,
  F                Em      Am    F G
I run and grab and soon forget


Dm                          C
I can see I feel two skies above
Dm                        C
One to be with, one - to love
Em                Am
I envy them. They never lose,
          Em            Am
'cos they have a choice not to choose
Dm                          G
I can see I feel two skies above

Dm                                       C
Clouds and clouds and clouds are passing by
Dm                                     C
Watch the clouds, while they cross the sky
   Em               Am
If I should choose among them all
    Em           Am
I'd be confused, I'd feel small
Dm                                       G
Clouds and clouds and clouds are passing by

  C               G
I may seem wise I may seem old
F                 Em             Am    F G
Feels like I just came into this world
  C               G
I beg and lie and then regret,
  F                Em      Am    F G
I run and grab and soon forget

  C               G
I may seem wise I may seem old
F                 Em             Am    F G
Feels like I just came into this world
  C               G
I beg and lie and then regret,
  F                Em           Am          F        G
I run and grab and soon forget  La la la la la la la la la la

                 Am          F        G
and soon forget  La la la la la la la la la la (x10)
