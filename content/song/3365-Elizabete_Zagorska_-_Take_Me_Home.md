```text
Take me home if you can
Even if you don’t know who I am
It’s so cold outside here
My heart feels so lonely and weird

You don’t what it takes when
Your heart is so broken like glass
One more mile to the freedom
It seems like a million and more

Be so kind, free my mind
Oh stranger please take me away
There’s no time to talk or lie
Just save me, I don’t want to die

You don`t what it takes when
Your heart is so broken like glass
One more mile to the freedom
It seems like a million and more

I felt like forever
But when he said never come back here
Don’t know if I ever
Will still be so able to resist

I felt like forever
But then he said never come back here
Don’t know if I ever
Will still be so able to resist

I felt like forever
But then he said never come back here
Don’t know if I ever
Will still be so able to resist

I felt like forever
But then he said never come back here
Don’t know if I ever
Will still be so able to resist
