```text
Do you feel your mind is racing once again?
When I say I understand you why.
You always have this yearning in your life,
You feel like you`re running all the time.
I try to read you between the lines.
I will be here for you when you are down.
I will be here for you through all the time.

You never had someone to be by your side
To care for you when you were down.
You had no-one to talk to through the night,
You were alone when you fought your fights.
And this is why you left our home that night.

I will be here for you when you are down.
I will be here for you through all the time.
No matter what you`ve done, here I will stay
And pray for you
To always keep you safe.

Now when I look at you
I can see how much you have grown
You’re so much stronger
Than you ever were before

Seems like you’re slowing down
You turn around, you’re coming home
I can feel it in my heart
Our new beginning starts right now!

I will be here for you when you are down.
I will be here for you through all the time.
No matter what you did, here I will stay
And pray for you
To always keep you safe.
