            E             Ebm
I'm going round in circles
         Abm            F#
And the door's wide open
        E                Ebm
Boy I still wanna see you
        Abm                    F#
Days go by, I'm still hoping, hoping

E
Where we draw the line?
Ebm            Abm
Tell me, baby, where we draw the line?
F#             E
Tell me, baby, where we draw the line?
Ebm            Abm          
Tell me, baby, where we draw the line?

      E               Ebm
You told me to move on
         Abm            
Searching now for somebody else
            F#     E                 Ebm
But baby, tell me how will I find it?
   Abm               F#
If all I see is you? All I see is you?

E
All I see is you, all I see
Abm
All I see is you, all I see

E
Where we draw the line?
Ebm            Abm
Tell me, baby, where we draw the line?
F#             E
Tell me, baby, where we draw the line?
Ebm            Abm          
Tell me, baby, where we draw the line?
