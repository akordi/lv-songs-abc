Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

Hey now, I’m here to seduce you
I am a kind of lady you want really bad
Shut up, no more words, I feel you
Nature of my body drives you really mad

Yeah, I feel how you’re breathing
Shy boy, show me your cards
I can be yours for real if
You don’t miss your best chance, best chance

Now or never, go away or
Take your chance, you lose nothing whatsoever
Now or never, go away or
Take your really best chance

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

Hey now, don’t be such a stranger
Every man’s a hunter and you are the same
Come on, ain’t no rules or borders
Now it’s time to play a real adult game

Yeah, I feel how you’re breathing
Shy boy, show me your cards
I can be yours for real if
You don’t miss your best chance, best chance

Now or never, go away or
Take your chance, you lose nothing whatsoever
Now or never, go away or
Take your really best chance

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
