[C] All I see is dark and clear
[C] All I feel is here and real

[Am] And when I’m wide awake [F]
[Am] I see all my mistakes [F]
[Am] And all the bones I break [F]
[Am] The world hears me say [F]

My [C] sky,  [Am]
[F] Circus in [C] my [Am] sky
My [C] sky,  [Am]
[F] Circus in [C] my [Am] sky
[C] You and [Am] I

The [C] stars in your [Am] eyes
Shine [C] bright to [Am] me
You’re [C] all i [Am] need

[C] This is [F] not the [Am] end
[C] We’re [F]  on the [Am] edge

[Am] Me and [C] You, 
Well [G] get [F] this [Am] through
[Am] On our [C] way, 
This [G] is [F] our [Am] way 

[Am] Me and [C] You, 
Well [G] get [F] this [Am] through
[Am] On our [C] way, 
This [G] is [F] our [Am] way 

My [C] sky 
[F][C][Am]
