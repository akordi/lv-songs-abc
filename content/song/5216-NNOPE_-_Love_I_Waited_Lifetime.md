```text
It [G] might take a [D] week or 
[Em] maybe [C] a day,
I [G] fall in love too [D] easy, 
do you [Em] think it’s [C] okey?
What’s [G] this bar on the [D] corner, 
they won’t [Em] let me [C] in
They [G] say I look too [D] sad 
to be [Em] drinking [C] again

  [G] Love I [D] waited [C] lifetime,
  [G] Love I [Bm] waited [Am] lifetime

Can I [G] take you to [D] home now, 
are you [Em] sure you’ll be [C] fine?
Do you [G] think that I am [D] rushing, 
do you [Em] need a bit more [C] time?
Let me [G] know what you’re [D] thinking, 
I can’t [Em] read your [C] mind
I [G] swear it will be [D] one more, 
[Em] one sleepless [C] night

  [G] Love I [D] waited [C] lifetime,
  [G] Love I [Bm] waited [Am] lifetime

[G] Dear [D] my, [C] where were you? 
[G] Dear [Bm] my, [Am] I saw you
[G] Dear [D] my, [C] where were you? 
[G] Dear [Bm] my, [Am] I saw you
