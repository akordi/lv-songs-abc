Here we [C] go, here we [F] go
So alive, in the sky, we can [C] Fly
Here we [C] go, here we [F] go
So alive, in the sky, we can [C] Fly

Ladies and Gentlemen, I need a starlight
'Cause I never had a day without a fight
I slid through the darkness, it took me to a height
Of a lonesome, cold and never ending night

I'm the man on the moon, call me Andy Kaufman
There are demons inside me but I'm stomp'em
I know I can be an unstoppable force
I try, me, let me take a walk on the bright side

Here we [C] go, here we [F] go
So alive, in the sky, we can [C] Fly
Here we [C] go, here we [F] go
So alive, in the sky, we can [C] Fly

A lot of thoughts in my head keep pulling me down
So many guests in my house I could not notice the sound
Of the doorbell telling they're about to come
I'm surrounded by problems, I got to run

(But no) I keep pulling myself up
(But no) I keep pulling myself up
I'm on a mission to fulfill my vision
All day, everyday, never ever, ever give up

Here we [C] go, here we [F] go
So alive, in the sky, we can [C] Fly
Here we [C] go, here we [F] go
So alive, in the sky, we can [C] Fly
Here we [C] go, here we [F] go
Here we [C] go, here we [F] go
So alive, in the sky, we can [C] Fly
