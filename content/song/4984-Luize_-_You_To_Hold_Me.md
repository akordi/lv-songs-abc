[Verse 1]
I don't know where the dead people go
Are they demons or maybe they're ghosts?
But all I can think is your lips on my cheeks
And I want to scream

[Refrain]
But you can't know all you're wanting to
When someone goes, your demons make it through

[Pre-Chorus]
All these demons make me think of you, I thought I'm stronger
Well, maybe someday
I will find someone who gives me more sense


[Chorus]
But I just want you (Hold me close)
To hold me
So, I can make it through (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
You just have to be thеre by my side (Oh)
Or eithеr I will lose my mind
Well of course, it is over
And I will get stronger
It hurts me so deeply

[Refrain]
But you can't know all you're wanting to
When someone goes, your demons make it through

[Pre-Chorus]
All these demons make me think of you, I thought I'm stronger
Well, maybe someday
I will find someone who gives me more sense

[Chorus]
But I just want you (Hold me close)
To hold me
So I can make it through
I can't breathe when you're not aside me
I won't let you go
I can fix all your demons, but I don't want to see you go

[Bridge]
But I just want you
To hold me

[Chorus]
But I just want you (Hold me close)
To hold me
So I can make it through (Hold me close)
To hold me
So I can make it through
