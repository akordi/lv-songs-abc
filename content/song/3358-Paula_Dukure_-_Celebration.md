Ring ring, wake up princess, this is your day
Watch your left foot when you jump out of bed
Turn on your smile and show your beautiful eyes
For everyone is counting years of your age

It’s just another day of the year, we will celebrate
You should go get a cake
It’s just another day of the year, we will celebrate
No matter what’s your age

All around, friends are all around
This is your day, you should celebrate
All around, friends are all around
So loud and louder every year, scream hurray! hurray!

Again ring ring and this is not your day
And it looks like all you’ve got is a mess
No one screams hurray on the very next day
It seems the party was a one-night stand

Don’t worry, this is the next day after your celebration
Go get a piece of cake
Don’t worry, this is the next day after your celebration
No matter what’s your age

All around, friends are all around
This is your day, you should celebrate
All around, friends are all around
So loud and louder every year, scream hurray! hurray!

Enjoy your moment
Blow all your candles
Make a wish
‘Cause one day you’re news
The next day day you’re old news

All around, friends are all around
This is your day, you should celebrate
All around, friends are all around
So loud and louder every year, scream hurray! hurray!

All around, friends are all around
You should celebrate
All around, friends are all around
I hope this year you will celebrate
Hurray! Hurray!
