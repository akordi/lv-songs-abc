Now that my eyes are closed I see
Pictures of how it all could be
They look incredible and irresistible to me

Changing so fast then fading out
Is this a dream where all is allowed?
Come on and share with me my night reality, let it be

Take off your mask and be who you are
Don’t be afraid and let it out
Say what you want, do what you want to
Our life is only for one time use
That you don’t wanna waste and lose

When I’m with you please don’t pretend
No matter what I’ll understand
We’ll travel far and wide
The sky is on our side in a free ride

Take off your mask and be who you are
Don’t be afraid and let it out
Say what you want, do what you want too
Our life is only for one time use
That you don’t wanna waste and lose

Lay down and sleep, live those pictures with me
They’re more than fantasy
With no offense, with no self defense
A life that is so free

Don’t be afraid and let it out
Say what you want, do what you want to
Our life is only for one time use
That you don’t wanna waste and lose

Don’t be afraid and let it out
Say what you want, do what you want to
Our life is only for one time use
That you don’t wanna waste and lose


Our life is only for one time use
That you don’t wanna waste and lose
Don’t be afraid
