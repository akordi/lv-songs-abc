[Intro]
Forgot about the pictures you sent
Back when we were more than not friends
Now there you go, lighting up my phone

[Verse 1]
You said you're in town for the weekend
We should grab a couple drinks, yeah, just friends
I think I know how this story goes

[Pre-Chorus]
We have a sip, it turns into two
My demons have way too much fun with you
Back of a cab, you're hotel room
Ready, set, doom


[Chorus]
This is fake love
Medicine with champagne love
Playing tricks with my brain love
So why the hell can’t I move on?
We got fake love
Pretty, but plastic play love
I like it, but it’s making me hate love
So why do I keep wanting more
Of your fake love? Yeah

[Verse 2]
Are we on? Are we off? In between?
Let me off of this ride, I’m dizzy
But here I go, writing you “Hello”

[Verse 3]
Guess we’re just crazy, dumb or bored
'Cause we know it’s never worked before
And every time I slam the door behind
How are you on the other side?

[Chorus]
This is fake love
Medicine with champagne love
Playing tricks with my brain love
So why the hell can’t I move on?
We got fake love
Pretty, but plastic play love
I like it, but it’s making me hate love
So why do I keep wanting more—

[Bridge]
We have a sip, it turns into two
My demons have way too much fun with you
Back of a cab, you're hotel room
Ready, set

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, this is fake love
Medicine with champagne love
Playing tricks with my brain love
So why the hell can’t I move on?
We got fake love
Pretty, but plastic play love
I like it, but it’s making me hate love
So why do I keep wanting more
Of your fake love? Yeah

[Outro]
Fake love
