[C] Chasing cars and [G] racing snails [Am]
They [C] like to hang out [G] in the woods [Am]
They [C] hate early [G] mornings and [Am] dead, sad faces
There’s [C] some kind of [G] sorce[Am]ry

But [F] when they start to [Am] daydream their minds [G] float straight to the [C] stars
But [F] when they start to [Am] daydream their minds [G] float straight to the [C] stars

  [C] Look around
  There’s something [Am] more
  [F] Can’t you see the [G] beauty in the ordinary

  [C] Look around
  There’s something [Am] more
  [F] Can’t you see the [G] beauty in the ordinary

[C] Building up and [G] crashing down [Am]
They’re [C] chatting with some [G] ghost [Am] friends
Seems [C] like the [G] golden days are [Am] gone forever
The [C] world they [G] used to [Am] know

But [F] when they start to [Am] daydream their minds [G] float straight to the [C] stars
But [F] when they start to [Am] daydream their minds [G] float straight to the [C] stars

  [C] Look around
  There’s something [Am] more
  [F] Can’t you see the [G] beauty in the ordinary

  [C] Look around
  There’s something [Am] more
  [F] Can’t you see the [G] beauty in the ordinary
