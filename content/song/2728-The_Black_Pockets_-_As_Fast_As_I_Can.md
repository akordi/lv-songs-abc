I saw her late that summer
C            Em7/G
Midnight runner
Dm7               Fmaj7
Not too long till we got closer
C       Em7/G
Got closer

Dm7              Fmaj7
Hearts and colors midnight runners
C           Em7/G
Under cover
 Dm7             C
I never needed approval of someone
Dm7     Em7
Anyhow, anyway
I know

  Fmaj7              Am7
  All my friends say I don’t need her
  G6                G9
  I should leave her
  Fmaj7              Am7
  All my friends say I don’t need her
  G6                    G9
  I should leave her as fast as i can 

As fast as i can
As fast as i can

She’s a woman that’s taking all my time
Eating all my time
Wasting days by waiting on sunsets
On sunsets

I’ll never regret those wasted sunsets
I’ll never forgot

I never needed approval of someone
Anyhow, anyway
I know

  All my friends say I don’t need her
  I should leave her

  All my friends say I don’t need her
  I should leave her as fast as i can 

As fast as i can
As fast as i can
