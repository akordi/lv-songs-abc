[Chorus]
Ooh la, la, like I wanna
Ooh la, la, like I wanna
Making all the rules and watch 'em break
 
[Verse]
I was born to be free-ee-ee
Make the tears and disobey my orders, oh-oh
I’m here only to see-ee-ee
Lines are meant to cross the same as borders, oh, oh
 
[Pre-Chorus]
So, just try tell me "It's a given"
I'm gonna die from a living
None of us have gotten another option
So I’ll be the toast of the party
Using up my body
Taking pictures I can leave behind (Oh)
 
[Chorus]
Ooh la, la, like I wanna
Ooh la, la, like I wanna
Making all the rules and watch 'em break, I'm gonna
Ooh la, la, like I wanna
Ooh la, la, likе I wanna
Dream as if I'm unafraid to wake
Into the еdge of—
 
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh la, la, like I wanna
Ooh la, la, like I wanna
Ooh la, la, like I wanna
Ooh la, la, la, la, la
Ooh la, la, like I wanna
Ooh la, la, like I wanna
Ooh la, la, like I wanna
 
[Verse 2]
Will you show me the way-ay-ay?
Blazing me a trail to revelation, oh (Ooh-ooh)
If I'm going to pray-ay-ay
It's a burden for my expectations, oh, oh
 
[Pre-Chorus]
So, just try tell me "It's a given"
I'm gonna die from a living
None of us have gotten another option
So I’ll be the toast of the party
Using up my body
Taking pictures I can leave behind (Oh)
 
[Chorus]
Ooh la, la, like I wanna
Ooh la, la, like I wanna
Making all the rules and watch ’em break, I'm gonna
Ooh la, la, like I wanna
Ooh la, la, like I wanna
Dream as if I’m unafraid to wake
Into the edge of—
 
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh la, la, like I wanna
Ooh la, la, like I wanna
Ooh la, la, like I wanna
Ooh la, la, la, la, la
Ooh la, la, like I wanna
Ooh la, la, like I wanna
Ooh la, la, like I wanna
Ooh la, la, la, la, la
 
[Outro]
Ooh la, la, like I wanna
