I was born in distant 1980

the year that Irish Johnny Logan won
F                            C/Am  
thirty years ago, they still remember
F
so dream away
C
today's the day
G               Am
I'm singing out my song

Am
When I join this grand parade of winners
C                                    G
and we've made this song a worldwide hit
F                                 C/Am
I will buy oh my own mike to sing in
F

C
I've had before

I'm surely gonna quit

Am
My Mom said I'd grow up to be a singer
C                                G
And Daddy smiled when gave me my guitar
F                                 C/Am
I do my best, and I'll be so much better
F                C               G               Am
Brightest of the highest and the farthest of the stars

Am
And on that day when Sir Mick Jagger phones me
C                                G
Tell him, please, that I am very busy

writing brand new songs with Paul McCartney
F              C                   G 
So sorry Mick, I'll call you back, someday I'll call
