```text
Once upon a time lived a girl
With a honey blonde hair and eyes like pearls
With a heart like a diamond and pristine soul
She was pretty indeed

And then came a day she went to a party
Beautifully dressed, excited she was
How to behave and how to look smarty
If prince is asking to dance

Would you be my lady Cinderella?
Would you play the game and dance with me
I would be your prince until the midnight
Let us happen what used to be

Dancing was short and then came a midnight
Tears in her eyes ’cause she had to leave
Way through the night leads to a daylight
Hard for her to believe

Would you be my lady Cinderella?
Would you play the game and dance with me
I would be your prince until the midnight
Let us happen what used to be

Would you be my lady Cinderella?
Would you play the game and dance with me
I would be your prince until the midnight
Let us happen what used to be

Would you be my lady Cinderella?
Would you play the game and dance with me
I would be your prince until the midnight
Let us happen what used to be

Would you be my lady? (Cinderella)
Would you be my lady? (Dance with me)
Would you be my lady Cinderella?
Let us happen what used to be
