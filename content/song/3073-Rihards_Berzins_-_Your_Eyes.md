```text
Seems you’re making me big surprise
When I look at you you’re hiding your beautiful eyes
How it’s gonna end, beginning is nice and slow
Time is running out and soon we’ll have to go

Your eyes like a beautiful, beautiful world
So nice like music with magical chords
Your eyes like a beautiful, beautiful world

Still nothing has changed at all
Now we’re standing behind a wall
But there is a light between your beautiful hands
And it shines so bright like glittering honey gland

The more I watched and the more I found
That you are looking around and around and around
The more I watched and the more I found
That you are looking around and around and around

Your eyes like a beautiful, beautiful world
So nice like music with magical chords
Your eyes like a beautiful, beautiful world
So, so nice like music with magical chords
