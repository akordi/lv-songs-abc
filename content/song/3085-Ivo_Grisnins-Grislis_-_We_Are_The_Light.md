This world is full of point of views
                                     Em
Every day comes mostly with negative news
C
There are wars and thousands of killed
                           Em
But who will pay the final bill?

   Em      C         Em      C
We are the light, we are the light
    Em                   Am
And there’s space to fly home
       Em      C         Em      C
But we are the light, we are the light
    Em               Am
Our mission is shine on

We have to hope, we have to heal
And then we won’t be scared or fear
And too much drops of hidden pain
Will fall from sky in dark summer rain

We are the light, we are the light
And there’s space to fly home
We are the light, we are the light
We are, we are, we are

We are the light, we are the light
Our mission is shine on
We are, we are, we are

Oh… oh…
We are the light, oh oh…
