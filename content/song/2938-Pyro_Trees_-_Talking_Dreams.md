```text
you talk to me
and the words go round and round
like an empty gun
full of lies
and we laugh so hard before we let it out

don't be the drama queen
of your own dreams
just give meaning to them
and take what is yours

abandoned rooms
forgotten oaths
these things keep coming down on me
but I don't care
the wall between 
the good and weak
brings me to surface
of the things I seek
```
