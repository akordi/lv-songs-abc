[C] Something not here the way, that [Am] was before
Now i [F] see - only my [C] two bare feet
How [C] many times we try to make it [Am] work, oh no
But the [F] way i am, for me it makes a [C] perfect sense

She said -
  I [C] want break highway
  I [C] want break highway
  I [Am] want this far away
  I [Am] want this far away
  I [C] want break highway
  I [C] want break highway
  I [Am] want to drive somewhere
  I [Am] want to drive somewhere

[C] Sense in my head with love
Never [Am] build that hard
All i need to [F] see
A place where my [C] last way needs

Oh, [C] there's like years in milky love
for like a [Am] nothing stars
And the way i [F] am, for me it makes a [C] perfect sense

She said -
  I [C] want break highway
  I [C] want break highway
  I [Am] want this far away
  I [Am] want this far away
  I [C] want break highway
  I [C] want break highway
  I [Am] want to drive somewhere
  I [Am] want to drive somewhere

I [C] run away, I run away, I run away
I run [Am] away
I [F] run away, I run away, I run away
I run [C] away

[C] I, I will run a [Am] highway
[F] I, I will run a [C] highway

[C] Something not here the way, that [Am] was before
Now i [F] see - only my [C] two bare feet
