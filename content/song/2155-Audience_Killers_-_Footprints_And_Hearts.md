People come and [C] go, [G] in and [Am] out of your [F] life
People come and [C] go, [G] go, go [Am] [F]
People come and [C] go, [G] in and [Am] out of your [F] life
People come and [C] go, [G] go, go [Am] [F]

[C] Few of [G] us stick [Am] around for a [F] lifetime
[C] Most are [G] here for [Am] a [F] season
[C] Love is [G] love and [Am] never goes [F] away
The [C] world’s [G] like that [Am] for no [F] reason

People come and [C] go, [G] in and [Am] out of your [F] life
People come and [C] go, [G] go, go [Am] [F]
People come and [C] go, [G] in and [Am] out of your [F] life
People come and [C] go, [G] go, go [Am] [F]

[C] Satis[G]fied [Am] with your [F] love
I’m [C] satis[G]fied [Am] with your [F] love 
[C] Satis[G]fied [Am] with your [F] love
I’m [C] satis[G]fied [Am] with your [F] love 

[C] Hellos and [G] goodbyes are [Am] diffi[F]cult
[C] What makes [G] someone [Am] stay in our [F] lives
[C] Nothing’s [G] the same, [Am] everything’s [F] changing
The [C] world’s [G] like that [Am] for no [F] reason

People come and [C] go, [G] in and [Am] out of your [F] life
People come and [C] go, [G] go, go [Am] [F]
People come and [C] go, [G] in and [Am] out of your [F] life
People come and [C] go, [G] go, go [Am] [F]
