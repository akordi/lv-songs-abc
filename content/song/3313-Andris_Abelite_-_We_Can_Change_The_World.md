```text
It’s time to open the doors which were closed
We must start to do what we learn
Full feel the words, every thought
And soon enough we will see how it’s worth

We can change the world and find our sky
Paint your dreams that’s let us fly
Enjoy each day and night that comes
Whatever you do, do it with love

There’s nothing in this world that can’t be
We can take it all if we are free
Free, without doubt, without fears
A love imagination to be reached

We can change the world and find our sky
Paint your dreams that’s let us fly
Enjoy each day and night that comes
Whatever you do, do it with love

We can change the world and find our sky
Paint your dreams that’s let us fly
Enjoy each day and night that comes
Whatever you do, do it with love
