```text
I'm on a road
To the promise land
Tossing and turning
Every night

I work hard every day
And every night
Cold sweat
Sleepless nights

Far,far from home
I feel deserted
I want to hold you tight
And never let go
(Pre-ch)
I'm a man with will
I never will give up
(Piedz)
Power of will
In my veins
My love will
Allways be for you

Too many years i
was fighting
Fighting for air to breathe
I want to be free

Everytime i had to leave
I lost the peace
Everytime i see you
I lost the tears

(Pre-ch)

(Piedz)(2x)

(Solo)

(Pre-ch)

(Piedz)(4x)
