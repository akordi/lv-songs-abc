My plane is leaving to bam badi bum
Thoughts are flying to the moon
Cabin crew save us from the unicorns
They try to steal us on-the-run

Cotton candy, cloudy bandit
I see a secret meaning and you cannot bend it
Plane is breathing with the broken dreams
People looks like empathic shrimps

Fasten seatbelts shakin’ shakin’
Turbulance can make it, make it
Fasten seatbelts shakin’ shakin’
Turbulance can make it, make it

Engines on, tanks are full of stereotypes
Stardust covers our minds
Fairies are dancing on the wings
Showing skin which glows and blings

Hidden wishes of the flying man
Uncovered by fairies and lead them to zen
Our plane is leaving, bam badi boom
Here’re the keys to your soul room

Fasten seatbelts shakin’ shakin’
Turbulance can make it, make it
Fasten seatbelts shakin’ shakin’
Turbulance can make it, make it

Flying babies in the sky draw the line
Flying under the morning lights, bam badi bam
Bam badi bam, bam badi bam
Bam badi bam, bam badi bam
Bam, bam, bam bam

Flying babies in the sky draw the line
But reality of morning flies to bam badi bam
Bam badi bam, bam badi bam
Bam badi bam, bam badi bam
Bam, bam, bam bam

Fasten seatbelts shakin’ shakin’
Fasten seatbelts shakin’ shakin’
