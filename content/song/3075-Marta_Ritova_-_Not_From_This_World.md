```text
I see your eyes
And I know that it is
Something more
That we find in our
In our regular world

Could it be so
That our souls’ meant to be
And we came back here
To meet in this
In this regular world

It is still deep, this strong
And it feels like hell when you’re not here
It is still deep, this strong
‘Cause this love is not from this world

Please give me some sign
To know that you’re gonna keep me
Safe from all of the pain
In this, in this regular world

It is still deep, this strong
And it feels like hell when you’re not here
It is still deep, this strong
‘Cause this love is not from this world

It is still deep, this strong
And it feels like hell when you’re not here
It is still deep, this strong
‘Cause this love is not from this world

It is still deep, this strong
And it feels like hell when you’re not here
It is still deep, this strong
‘Cause this love is not from this world
