I have something to say
By the way, I don't want to complain complain
I've been waiting for You all these days
By the way, You didn't came

But I know You feel the same
Cause we fell in Love since the first day
But I know You feel the same
Cause we fell in Love since the first day

You tell me you want to be, alone but I will Love You even if You go
It's strange to feel this way I know, I know

Will think the best don't ask me sorry just let me fly to another story
And keep Your heart clear and mind kind
And please don't run away, cause You know that You have to stay
So please don't run away
When You know that You have to stay

And I know You feel the same
Cause we fell in Love since the first day
And I know You feel the same
Cause we fell in Love since the first day

I am not a blind I can see behind 
I can see behind have Your heart is fighting with Your Mind
I am not a blind I can see behind 
I can see behind have Your heart is fighting with Your Mind
And I have something to say
By the way, I will make it anyway
And I have something to say
By the way, I will make it anyway

And I know You feel the same
Cause we fell in Love since the first day
And I know You feel the same
Cause we fell in Love since the first day

And I know You feel the same
Cause we fell in Love since the first day
And I know You feel the same
Cause we fell in Love since the first day
