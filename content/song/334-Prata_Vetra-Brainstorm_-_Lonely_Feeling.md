LONELY FEELING (TO BE LONELY) (Rudens; Veter)

INTRO ||Em | A | Em | A || 2x
      || Em A | Bm | Em A | Bm || 2x

PANTS || Em A | Bm | G |A ||
     Em    A       Bm
like ships without anchors
      G                A                  
wide is the ocean, no islands, no shores
     Em    A      Bm
all is well, only
        G             A
this is such a lonely feeling to be lonely

fame is illusion
bright are the lights and you - you are left in confusion
all is well, only
this is such a lonely feeling
this is such a lonely feeling

PIEDZ || Em A | BmSUS4 | Em A | BmSUS4 ||
      || Em A | BmSUS4 | Em A | G | A | G | A | A ||

Em      A            BmSUS4
driving fast as fast as i can
   Em       A              BmSUS4
or sitting quietly on the windowsill
Em         A       BmSUS4
you've got all and nothing
Em          A                 Bm
just put no more loneliness on my bill
Em      A             G          
this is such a lonely feeling

PANTS || Em A | Bm | G |A ||

all songs should be happy
actors young and soap operas crappy
movies are x-rays
our destinies are chosing our ways

and what should we do?
to enjoy life the most or hiding like ghosts?
all is well, only
this is such a lonely feeling
this is such a lonely feeling

PIEDZ || Em A | BmSUS4 | Em A | BmSUS4 ||
      || Em A | BmSUS4 | Em A | G | A | G | A | A ||

driving fast as fast as i can
or sitting quietly on the windowsill
you've got all and nothing
just put no more loneliness on my bill

driving fast as fast as i can
or sitting quietly on the windowsill
you've got all and nothing
just put no more loneliness on my bill
