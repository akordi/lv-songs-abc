Take a look at me now 
I have nowhere to hide anymore 
When you're not around 
When you're not around 

So, what have I done 
You never told me that you had to move on 
I'm falling to the ground
I'm falling to the ground, ground 

Rush, rush 
Memories, they're all runnin' by 
Rush, rush 
So I raise my glass and sing to the sky 

When the stars align that's a sign 
Can't you see it 
I will cross a line for a dime 
Can you feel it 
When the stars align that's a sign 
Can't you see it 
My mind's so lost on you 

My mind's so lost on you 

My mind's so lost on you 

Eletric shock straight trough my heart 
I wish that we could go back to the start 
I'll just carry on, on 

So, what have I done 
You never told me that you had to move on 
I'm falling to the ground
I'm falling to the ground, ground 

Rush, rush 
Memories, they're all runnin' by 
Rush, rush 
So I raise my glass and sing to the sky 

When the stars align that's a sign 
Can't you see it 
I will cross a line for a dime 
Can you feel it 
When the stars align that's a sign 
Can't you see it 
My mind's so lost on you 

My mind's so lost on you 

My mind's so lost on you 

My mind's so lost on you 

When the stars align that's a sign 
Can't you see it 
I will cross a line for a dime 
Can you feel it 
When the stars align that's a sign 
Can't you see it 
My mind's so lost on you 

My mind's so lost on you 

My mind's so lost on you
