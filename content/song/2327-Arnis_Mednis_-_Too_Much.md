[C] The day before [F] marriage, [Am] I was out so [F] long in the [C] night
[C] My lovely [F] fiancée [Am] no more is [F] feelin' my [C] sight
[C] Why do I [F] feel this way? – [Am] Dunno, last [F] night was [C] great
[C] But something's [F] screwin' me up, [Am] I swear to [F] God I will [G] stop

  [C] Too [F] much, too [G] much, too much, I [C] say
  [C] My [F] life - it [G] looks like a caba[C]ret
  Too [F] much, too [G] much, too much, [C] enough
  I [F] swear I'll [G] never use that [C] stuff

  [C] Oo... [G] baby, [F] take me back [G] (Okay)
  [C] Oh.... [G] give me [F] one more smile [G] (All right)
  [C] You're [G] mine and [F] only one [G] (We'll see)
  [C] Why, [G] darling, [F] you don't [G] come?

[C] The day after [F] marriage, [Am] I went in the [F] streets with my [C] bride
[C] She wanted [F] coffee – [Am] oh no, I'm [F] voting for [C] beer
[C] You see how [F] good is she – [Am] my caring, [F] lovely fianc[C]ée
[C] We walked into the [F] bar through light [Am] Oh God - there's [F] girls from last [G] night

  [C] Too [F] much, too [G] much, too much, I [C] say
  [C] My [F] life - it [G] looks like a caba[C]ret
  Too [F] much, too [G] much, too much, [C] enough
  I [F] swear I'll [G] never use that [C] stuff

  [C] Oo... [G] baby, [F] take me back [G] (Okay)
  [C] Oh.... [G] give me [F] one more smile [G] (All right)
  [C] You're [G] mine and [F] only one [G] (We'll see)
  [C] Why, [G] darling, [F] you don't [G] come? (Too much)
