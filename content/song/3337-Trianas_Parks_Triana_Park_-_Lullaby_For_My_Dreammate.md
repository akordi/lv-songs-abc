```text
I’ll be a little bird that sits by your side
I’ll wonder how you taste and what is inside
In your little heart

I’ll be powder of the sun that you never see
I will touch your hair whenever wind carries me to you

I will be your temple when you are at home
I will shine the stars so you won’t feel alone
I will tell the storm to go back where it laid
So you won’t be afraid
So you won’t be afraid

You can just dream another dream of me
You can just dream another dream of me
You can just dream another dream of me
You can just dream another dream of me

You can just dream another dream of me
You can just dream another dream of me
You can just dream another dream of me
You can just dream another dream of me
