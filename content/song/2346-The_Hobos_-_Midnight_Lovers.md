```text
It's five in the morning, someone knocking on
my door
You must be crazy, no my man I'm bored
I have to work tomorrow, it'll be a hard day
All right now let me use you astray

Uh, ah! Wonderful feeling
Uh, ah! What a nice day
Uh, ah! Busy busy crowd all around me
Uh, ah! And there's nothing more to say

It's five in the morning and I'm listening to the
radio
Sleepy music But I don't have to sleep no more
This night is crazy and so are you
All right doodby dooby do now

Uh, ah! Wonderful feeling
Uh, ah! What a nice day
Uh, ah! Busy busy crowd all around me
Uh, ah! And there's nothing more to say

So I don't and I wont

A bit of time later with the first sun rays
I saw the trace of grace in your face
I've never seen your dreams and I've never
been there
I got my dreams, maybe more, oh yeah!
So I looked in your eyes so wise as you rise
Above the timeless of my lies
