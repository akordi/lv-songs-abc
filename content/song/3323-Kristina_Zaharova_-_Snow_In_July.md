Here we go, two actors from the show
Summer heat made our motions slow
This is it, there’s nothing good or bad
But it is the best we’ve ever had

Here we come, here we go, you and I
Lucky people kissing goodbye, you and I
Searching for the perfect snow in July

All we need is just another chance
You and me, two dancers with no dance
Come and go, we’re always on that way
And you know, love is the game we play

Here we come, here we go, you and I
Lucky people kissing goodbye, you and I
Searching for the perfect snow in July

We don’t know what is it, we don’t know what it used to be
But all over the world people searching for that one thing

Here we come, here we go, you and I
Lucky people kissing goodbye, you and I
Searching for the love we’re getting high

Here we come, here we go
Lucky people kissing goodbye, you and I
Searching for the perfect snow in July
Snow in July, snow in July
