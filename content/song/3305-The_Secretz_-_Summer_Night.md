I’m waking up on Sunday morning, it’s 9am
With sunshine in my hair in this last summer morning
I don’t want to stay at home, everything annoys me now
I don’t care the streets are quiet, anyway I’m getting out

Summer heat is almost over, I don’t have to be so sad
It’s impossible to steal all the memories I had
It’s not too late to feel emotions, bring them back to life
So I call all my friends to take them with me, to celebrate

I want my summer back tonight without any worries
I want my summer back with you, to make new love stories
I want my summer back tonight without any worries
I want my summer back with you, to make new love stories

I see my friends are smiling at me, it’s 9pm
The party’s almost started, we are going to the beach
Faraway the beacon light is leading ships into the night
We are all in this together, to celebrate last summer night

As we dance along the beach, leaving footprints in the sand
Clinking glasses of champagne we say together cheers!
It’s not too late to feel emotions, bring them back to life
So I call all my friends to take them with me, to celebrate

I want my summer back tonight without any worries
I want my summer back with you, to make new love stories
I want my summer back tonight without any worries
I want my summer back with you

It’s not too late to feel emotions, bring them back to life
So I call all my friends to take them with me, to celebrate

I want my summer back tonight without any worries
I want my summer back with, back with, back with you

I want my summer back tonight without any worries
I want my summer back with you, to make new love stories
I want my summer back tonight without any worries
I want my summer back with you, to make new love stories

I want my summer back tonight
I want my summer back tonight
I want my summer back tonight
