Everlasting feelings capture me
Never-ending moments for you and me

Don’t bring me rain if you want me to stay
‘Cause you see how much it means to me to have you near
Don’t bring me lies and no pain, let me rise
And remain the one and only one you feel for real

It’s been quite a while
Since you and me both met in harmony
Just to break free
To make our lives as special as could be

But I’m a girl
That doesn’t want to have no harm
So you gotta beware
To have me for all life, remember

Don’t bring me rain if you want me to stay
‘Cause you see how much it means to me to have you near
Don’t bring me lies and no pain, let me rise
And remain the one and only one you feel for real

Everlasting feelings capture me
Never-ending moments for you, remember

Don’t bring me rain if you want me to stay
‘Cause you see how much it means to me to have you near
Don’t bring me lies and no pain, let me rise
And remain the one and only one you feel for real

Don’t bring me rain if you want me to stay
‘Cause you see how much it means to me to have you near
Don’t bring me lies and no pain, let me rise
And remain the one and only one you feel for real

Don’t bring me rain
