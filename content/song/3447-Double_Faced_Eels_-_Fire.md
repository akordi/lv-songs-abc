I’ve got a fire burning deep inside
Illuminates my way when there’s no light
Whatever comes my way, I’ll be alright
‘Cause I’ve got that fire-fire-fire
Got that fire-fire-fire

Never was the type to fit in / Least likely to succeed
Never was the type to listen / Always marching to my own beat
Never had a doubt in my mind / Ain’t got no quit in me
All I’ve got’s a burning hunger / cuts and bruises to remind me
 
Learned from my pain and heartache / turned all that into fuel
All of the rage that I felt / yeah, I put in my rear-view
Feel tall like the highest tower / there ain’t no stopping me
All I’ve got’s a burning hunger / and voices in my head, they’re singing

I’ve got a fire burning deep inside
Illuminates my way when there’s no light
Whatever comes my way, I’ll be alright
‘Cause I’ve got that fire-fire-fire
Got that fire-fire-fire

Stood on the edge of darkness / Felt my spirit breaking
Thought that there's no going back / My girl, my friends and family saved me
Don't know if I picked the right path / Or where it's leading me
All I've got's a burning hunger / and voices in my head, they're singing

Whatever comes my way, I’ll be alright
‘Cause I’ve got that fire-fire-fire
Got that fire-fire-fire

I’ve got a fire, burning deep inside, a fire burning deep inside
I’ve got a fire, burning deep inside, a fire burning deep inside
I’ve got a fire
