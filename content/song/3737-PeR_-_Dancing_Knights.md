Verse:
We dance, we dance, we dance
We move ourselves, we move ourselves
Down the blues, down the blues, down the blues

And then they fall, they fall, they fall
Our naked bodies, our naked bodies
These final moves, dancing moves, dancing moves

Chorus:
Cause we were chasing all the guiding lights,
We were chasing all the guiding lights
See it in my eyes, my eyes, my eyes
That we were chasing all the guiding lights

So when we're falling you could feel the sky
When we're falling you could feel the sky
Tonight, all night, all night
When we're falling you-you could feel the sky

Verse:
We dance, we dance, we dance
We move ourselves, we move ourselves
Down the blues, down the blues, down the blues

Chorus:
Cause we were chasing all the guiding lights,
We were chasing all the guiding lights
You can see it in my eyes, my eyes, my eyes
Cause we were chasing all guiding lights

Bridge 2x:
You got me now (I'm with you)
These shining stars (they take us)
Far away now (like knights we)
Follow the lights the lights we follow

Chorus:
Cause we were chasing all the guiding lights,
We were chasing all the guiding lights
See it in my eyes, my eyes, my eyes
That we were chasing all the guiding lights

So when we're falling you could feel the sky
When we're falling you could feel the sky
Tonight, all night, all night
When we're falling you could feel the sky
