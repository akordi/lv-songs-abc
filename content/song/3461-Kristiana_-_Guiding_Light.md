Warm touch
You kiss me and I'm out of space
I'm flyin' out of reach
I'm flyin' out of space
And just because of your touch

Long ride
You take me somewhere we can hide
Somewhere down this road
Our heartbeats make a song
You take me on a long ride

And I'm falling deeper in your blue eyes
Suddenly we both get lost till sunrise

Overseas, across the sky
I'd follow you tonight
It's like you're my guiding light
Breathing calm and breathing fast
I know this story will never last
I know this story will never last
Will never last

Our thoughts
Are separate, but then they meet
It's like a mystery, but everything is real
I'm lovin' what I see

Your hands
Wrapped around me so I'm safe
Just small and silly things
But love is what they bring
Tonight we both have wings

And I'm falling deeper in your blue eyes
Suddenly we both get lost till sunrise

Overseas, across the sky
I'd follow you tonight
It's like you're my guiding light
Breathing calm and breathing fast
I know this story will never last
I know this story will never last
Will never last

And this gets better
With every second
With every heartbeat
You're closer to me
We're dancing slowly
Oh, could you hold me
For eternity

Overseas, across the sky
I'd follow you tonight
It's like you're my guiding light

Overseas, across the sky
I'd follow you tonight
It's like you're my guiding light
Breathing calm and breathing fast
I know this story will never last
I know this story will never last
Will never last
