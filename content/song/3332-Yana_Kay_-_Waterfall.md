```text
Is this your whisper that’s calling me out
Or it’s just the rustle of grass?
Is this the sun floating in the cloud
Or I feel the heat of your eyes?

I’m diving so deep in your soul
Oh… this river takes me to you

Your love’s like a waterfall
Falling to the veil of my dreams
Not enough for life to take it all
This love’s like waterfall
Your love’s like waterfall

Gentle wind runs around my wings
It reminds me your embrace
The taste of you staying on my lips
Is a gift of your sweet kiss

I’m lulling your haze
And your stream carries me to where I’ve never been

Your love’s like a waterfall
Falling to the veil of my dreams
Not enough for life to take it all
This love’s like waterfall
Your love’s like waterfall

Your love’s like a waterfall
Falling to the veil of my dreams
Not enough for life to take it all
This love’s like waterfall
Your love’s like waterfall

Your love’s like waterfall
Ooh… waterfall
