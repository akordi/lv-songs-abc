```text
[C] When I need your empty hand
You [Am] find somebody [C] new
When [C] all the pain turn into blue
There's [Am] nothing I can [C] prove

[C] And when it all has been washed away
[Am] Did not expect to be the hardest part
[C] All our fading silhouettes
[Am] Have gone away

Sounds like [C] you
Sounds like [Am] you
Sounds like [C] you
Sounds like [Am] you
Sounds like [C] you
Sounds like [Am] you
Sounds like [C] you
Sounds like [Am] you 
Sounds like [C] you

[Am] Driving miles in the [C] city dawn
[Am] All the ghosts turn into [C] smoke
[Am] There is nothing I can [C] do, I can [Am] do [C]
