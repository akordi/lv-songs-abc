```text
I know that I exist but why I even care
You seem to be here but I can’t see your hair
I just want to lay down here, alone by myself
‘Cause there is nothing out there, just my consciousness

Just my consciousness, anything could be out there
Alone by myself, I just want to get away
Oh, I can see your hair, you don’t seem to be here
But why I even care, I know that I exist

And here I am
Standing in a field of billion exploding stars
Billion exploding stars that I am
Also made of

I know that I live and you live too
In my head all these pictures are more real than life out there
Today I will wear your suit and your black necktie
To know how it is to live in my world

To know how it is to live in my world
Today I will wear your dress and your lipstick
I know that I live and you live too
But I’m not really sure if you exist

And here I am
Standing in a field of billion exploding stars
Billion exploding stars that I am
Also made of
Sometimes I lose control so I died a long time ago

I am the nefelibata
I am the nefelibata
