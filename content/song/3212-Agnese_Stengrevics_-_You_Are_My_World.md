```text
People today
are scared to love
Pure hearts of theirs
are scared to trust
However, we try
our souls will seek
That somebody 
Who will take care of us

I wanna hold you
And never let you go
Cuz baby you are my world
Forever in my heart

Brown eyes of yours
Took the heart of mine
The way you look 
Make me smile again
The way you talk 
Make me feel like I matter
I really hope it will last forever

You are my world 
You are my world 
You are my world 
You are my world 

Although I'm scared to get hurt again
I'm ready to take the risk, oh
Even for a tiny life-ride with you

I wanna hold you
And never let you go
Cuz baby you are my world
Forever in my heart

However, I try
My soul will hold on you
You'll always be
My somebody
