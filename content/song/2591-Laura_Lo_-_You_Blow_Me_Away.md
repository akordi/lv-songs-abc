[F] Bloody [G] lipstick [Am] has stacked on my lips
[F] I’m wearing [G] my best smile [Am] for you
You blow me [F] away	
[G] And not just to[C]day

  [F] Taste my kiss and [G] drink my soul
  You’re a [Am] vampire, like a vampire
  [F] Mess my hair, my [G] life - I swear
  You’re a [Am] monster, like a monster

[F][G][Am]
[F][G][Am]

[F] Stunning, [G] still burning
[Am] Picture perfect charmer
[F] Unexpected, [G] but I [Am] like it
This [F] chemistry is [G] chasing me
[Am] Trapped into my dreams
There’s [F] something more and you [G] know it
Just [Am] face it and try

  [F] Taste my kiss and [G] drink my soul
  You’re a [Am] vampire, like a vampire
  [F] Mess my hair, my [G] life - I swear
  You’re a [Am] monster, like a monster

[F][G][Am]
[F][G][Am]

[F] Stunning, still [G] burning
[Am] Picture perfect charmer [F][G]
You blow me [Am] away...

  [F] Taste my kiss and [G] drink my soul
  You’re a [Am] vampire, like a vampire
  [F] Mess my hair, my [G] life - I swear
  You’re a [Am] monster, like a monster

[F] Taste my kiss, [G] drink my soul
[Am] Mess my hair, my life - I swear..
