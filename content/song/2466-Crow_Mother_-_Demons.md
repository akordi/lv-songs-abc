```text
Those sleepless nights
Too much demons to fight
Somebody stop the time

Too much people around
I'm loosing peace that I found
Have to find it again

Wake me up
Nightmare has gone

Wake me up
Nightmare has gone

I'ts a new day
It's a new life
But I’ll never know
What tomorrow brings

I'ts a new day
It's a new life
But I’ll never know
What tomorrow brings

I hear a laughter of clouds
They’re asking me out
Teasing my spirit and my belief
I’m ready to follow, to go now

Wake me up
Let me scream

I'ts a new day
It's a new life
But I’ll never know
What tomorrow brings

I'ts a new day
It's a new life
But I’ll never know
What tomorrow brings

I'ts a new day
It's a new life
But I’ll never know
What tomorrow brings

I'ts a new day
It's a new life
You come and go
For a million miles and more

Yeah
