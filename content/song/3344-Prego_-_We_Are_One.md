Sunrise makes the world wake up today,
Morning wind makes shore that night won’t stay,
Happy people help each other to find their way,
These are the things that happen every day.

Cause world is one and it’s made for all,
We will fight and we won’t let you fall.
When we are one we are small, but we’ll unite and we’ll be strong,
And absolutely nothing can go wrong.

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, we’ll be strong,
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, we’ll be strong,
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, we’ll be strong,
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, we’ll be strong.

In happiness grass always seems to be greener,
Birds sing louder and trees grow higher.
Listen how children are laughing and playing,
We can make this it last forever.

Cause world is one and it’s made for all,
We will fight and we won’t let you fall.
When we are one we are small, but we’ll unite and we’ll be strong,
And absolutely nothing can go wrong.

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, we’ll be strong,
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, we’ll be strong,
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na,
Na, na, na, na, na, na, absolutely nothing can go wrong.

Happy people help each other to find their way,
These are the things that happen each day.
