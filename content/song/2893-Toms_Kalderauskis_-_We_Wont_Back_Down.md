When there’s thunder i can touch the rain
Lonely boarders make me go insane
Tonight we’re gonna rise
There’s no more sacrifice
We won’t back down
We won’t back down

  We are the kings of the world
  Love always conquers hate
  We are the kings of the world
  Our faith will never fade
  We are the kings of the world
  We’re gonna get this race yeah hey yeah hey yeah
  I say we won’t back down

We can climb the highest of the hills
All we need is our strong will
Nothing can make me break
With every prayer i say
We won’t back down
We won’t back down

  We are the kings of the world
  Love always conquers hate
  We are the kings of the world
  Our faith will never fade
  We are the kings of the world
  We’re gonna get this race yeah hey yeah hey yeah
  I say we won’t back down

From the beginning to end
We never give up

  We are the kings of the world
  Love always conquers hate
  We are the kings of the world
  Our faith will never fade
  We are the kings of the world
  We’re gonna get this race yeah hey yeah hey yeah
  I say we won’t back down
