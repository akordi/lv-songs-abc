```text
Here's a story of my friend,
Since we met it has no end

I don't know the answer why --
He was simply real guy

Day by day and back to back
Endless road like endless track

He's with me from dusk 'till dawn,
Never felt myself alone

Let me sing you song, my buddy,
Let me share with you
My wings

Nevermind, just sing this melody together
Nevermind and let the dreams come true!
Don't be blind, just live this moment now or never,
Your friend are with you

Everyday with morning sun I used to go,
He used to run

Knew him since he was a child,
All the life was running wild

We don't have much time in this world,
Don't forget about these words
```
