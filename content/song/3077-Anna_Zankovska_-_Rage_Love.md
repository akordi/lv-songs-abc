```text
Too late, you made me hate, it’s too late
No way for you to escape, no way

Oh, this comedy is getting so old
And a heartache is again repeating
You should have never brought her home
Then maybe I would see the reason

I see you mouthing all those words
What you’re not getting? I don’t hear them
I raised you for the happiness
But what I came by I got the freedom

How could you possibly do that to someone who love you that hard?
You brought deception to a whole new level, you made it an art
I paint my nails in a colour of vengeance to tear you apart
Ask for no mercy, it’s too late for pity, run and hide

The rage, love, take me away
The rage
The rage will make me okay
The rage

It pains me dearly to give up
And start it over, take a lover
Am I supposed to make it stop?
But all you do is make me smaller

We both could use some growing up
But first I have to make you suffer
Your pain goes easy on my wounds
As you get weaker I get tougher

How could you possibly do that to someone who love you that hard?
You brought deception to a whole new level, you made it an art
I paint my nails in a colour of vengeance to tear you apart
Ask for no mercy, it’s too late for pity, run and hide

How could you possibly do that to someone?
Your deception hurts me like a shotgun
You lies, false potencies and misinformation
They broke, they fractured our old relation

I sharpen, I paint my nails in a colour of vengeance
The struggle is real, come out and face it
There is no mercy, it’s too late for pity, run and hide

The rage, love, take me away
The rage
The rage will make me okay

The rage, love, take me away
The rage
The rage will make me okay
The rage

The rage, love, take me away
The rage
The rage will make me okay
The rage
