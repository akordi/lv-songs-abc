Hear a voice from the distance
I am waiting quietly for you
Can’t explain what I’m doing
But I’m burning, I’m burning
I’m burning for you

Got to show you my feelings
I am dreaming, babe, about you
Just remember all those things
You have told me before

You have told me before
You have told me before
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-told

But you only want a good time
Easy come and easy go
But you never show your feelings
You’re as cold as a winter’s snow

But you only want a good time
I remember I was told
That you never show your feelings
‘Cause they always are kept on hold

I was glad that I found you
I’ve been waiting for this every day
Now it’s locked inside my soul
I’ll be keeping my love

I’ll be keeping my love, keeping my love
Keep, keep, keep, keep, keep, keep, keep, keep
Keep, keep, keep, keep, k-k-k-k-keep

But you only want a good time
Easy come and easy go
But you never show your feelings
You’re as cold as a winter’s snow

But you only want a good time
I remember I was told
That you never show your feelings
‘Cause they always are kept on hold

‘Cause they always are kept on hold
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold

But you only want a good time, good time
You only want a good time
But you never show your feelings
You’re as cold as a snow

But you only want a good time
I remember I was told
That you never show your feelings
‘Cause they always are kept on hold
