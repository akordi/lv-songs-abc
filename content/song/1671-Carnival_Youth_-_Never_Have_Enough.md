Intro + Panti + pre-chorus
D   G Bm   A F#m  E F#m

G  D
      eyes wide
G Bm
open
try to find 
A         F#m
my memories
birds tweet
E       F#m
river flows

best friends
       G    D
are my family

so generous 
fearless
they gave us
happines
you are
fire
that scares away
my bitterness

pre-chorus:
never have enough of this
i'll never have enough of this
never have enough of this
i'll never have enough of this
never have enough of this
i'll never have enough of this
never have enough of this
i'll never have enough of this


chorus:
D                    F#m  
   sunlight in your eyes
     A 
dont end
                   E
we all are your friends
D                        F#m
    and let yourself a smile
      A
dont end
                   E 
we all are your friends

there are
no confusions
as they say
the life should be

i leared
certainty
but you have
taught me

there's nothing 
between us
a bit of joy
and memories

i'm proud
of being here
nowhere else
but my family

never have enough of this
i'll never have enough of this
never have enough of this
i'll never have enough of this
never have enough of this
i'll never have enough of this
never have enough of this
i'll never have enough of this

chorus:

sunlight in your eyes
dont end
we all are your friends

and let yourself a smile
dont end 
we all are your friends
