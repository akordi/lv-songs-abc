Intoxicating scent sends wild flashes right in my prudence
Agitating dead ends easily crashes
I'm ready to dance

Sticky caramel in both my ears
Buzzing bumble-bee time disappears

The feeling 
I'm 16
Indecently twisty 
Shakes my misty mind since he kissed me

Intoxicating scent sends wild flashes right in my prudence
Agitating dead ends easily crashes
I'm ready to dance
Intoxicating scent sends wild flashes right in my prudence
Agitating dead ends easily crashes
I'm ready to dance

This leaky faucet 
Oh how can I knock it?
Crashing comet
Damages moonlit sky
And this chronically trembling rabbit
Unsettles my habit
To live in a landlocked rocket

Intoxicating scent sends wild flashes right in my prudence
Agitating dead ends easily crashes
I'm ready to dance
Intoxicating scent sends wild flashes right in my prudence
Agitating dead ends easily crashes
I'm ready to dance

The feeling 
I'm 16
Indecently twisty 
Shakes my misty mind since he kissed me

Intoxicating scent sends wild flashes right in my prudence
Agitating dead ends easily crashes
I'm ready to dance
Intoxicating scent sends wild flashes right in my prudence
Agitating dead ends easily crashes
I'm ready to dance
