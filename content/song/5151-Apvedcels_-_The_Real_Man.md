```text
I'm real mad my life goes only by the scroll
I don't drink and drive and rock n roll
I'm a real man just a little bit shy
And I doped and dope till the oceans get dry

When the memories of my words and people remain
When the words would be mentioned only in the tales
I would smile through the clouds on what I'm done
They will say he lived like a rat they got a son

That strongest Terminator
I cry like alligator I surely can't live as long as creature I frighten shoes
I fly to jail but I doped and dope you
My body begins to fade

When the memories of my words and people remain
When the walls would be mentioned only in the tales
I would smile through the clouds somewhat
I'm down they will say he'll leave like they got a son now
I'm solid as a rock, but I would be starring in those dancing halls
I would see Jim Beam

I'm a real man just a little bit shy
And I'd hoped and hoped till the oceans get dry

When the memories of my works and me will remain
When the wars would be mentioned only in the tales
I would smile through the clouds somewhat
And they would say he lived like a God of sun

When the memories of my works and people remain
When the words would be mentioned only in the tales
I would smile through the clouds somewhat
And they would say he lived like a God of sun

When the memories of my works and me will remain
When the words would be mentioned only in the tales
I would smile to the clouds of mine
And they would say he lived like a God of sun
