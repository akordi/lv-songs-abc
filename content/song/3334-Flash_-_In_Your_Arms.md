Before I met you I didn’t know
The meaning of love.
I feel so sad and insecure,
Facing my problems.

Then you just turned and smiled at me
And everything was so clear
Boy, I realized that we were meant to be.

In your arms
I feel so warm and safe inside, hold me tighter,
In your eyes
I see the wonder and surprise for all my life.

When I feel blue
You know the way to make me
Smile again,
I’ m pretty sure you know.

Now I believe that dreams come true
Because of you, boy.
I found a place where I belong,
Always by your side. (I will stay)

Just take me closer to your heart
And you’ll be close to mine
Don’ t keep me longing for your slightest touch.

In your arms
I feel so warm and safe inside, hold me tighter,
In your eyes
I see the wonder and surprise for all my life.

When I feel blue
You know the way to make me
Smile again,
I’ m pretty sure you know.

Don’t leave me, don’t hurt me, just say that you will love me,
We’ll stay together till the end of time.

In your arms
I feel so warm and safe inside, hold me tighter,
In your eyes
I see the wonder and surprise for all my life.

When I feel blue
You know the way to make me
Smile again,
I’ m pretty sure you know.

In your arms.
