```text
spent an hour arguing about walls 
you wanted to paint them red but i prefer the blue  
dark blue
i needed to air my heavy head after all
those nights that we'd slept on a matress on the floor

oh dark nights
full of laughter and groans  and vibrant beats
we couldn't dance but that's alright our fingers 
somehow found their way

remember the rainy summer evenings in town
under cold wet clothes your body was firm and warm
spent a summer sparing every slice of bread
but when we got dark we got rich  our ceiling were 
clouds above

oh dark nights
full of laughter and groans  and vibrant beats
we couldn't dance but that's alright our fingers 
somehow found their way
(2x)
