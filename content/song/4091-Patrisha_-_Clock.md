A clock is ticking around, around, around.
It is saying tick tock, tick tock ,tick tock.
A clock is screaming it’s time, it’s time, it’s time.
Clock, clock, clock is saying tick tock.

Every day, every night,
Second by second, hour by hour,
Day by day, night by night,
All my life it’s screaming the time.

A clock is climbing up and up the wall.
It is saying tick tock, tick tock, tick tock.
A clock is screaming when it’s time to go out.
A clock is dying when it’s heart is standing still.

Every day, every night,
Second by second, hour by hour,
Day by day, night by night,
All my life it’s screaming the time. 

uuuu…
aaaa….    

Every day, every night,
Second by second, hour by hour,
Day by day, night by night,
All my life it’s screaming the time. (2x)
