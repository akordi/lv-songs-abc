So there is something
I really want you to know
I love you darling

About that I'm sure

And when the sun rise
Shining on our way
Or even rainstorm
Listens how we pray

We gonna stay right here
We have to live like this
‘Cause there is nothing higher
Than the lovers bliss

We gonna stay right here
We have to live like this
‘Cause there is nothing higher
Than the lovers bliss, oh yeah

Lovers bliss, oh yeah
Lovers bliss, oh yeah
Lovers bliss, oh yeah

Standing in crossroads
Got that feelin' where to go
I'm holding you hand
Our hearts are beating strong

It is so simple
And hard at the same time
To love somebody
With openly wide heart

We gonna stay right here
We have to live like this
‘Cause there is nothing higher
Than the lovers bliss

We gonna stay right here
We have to live like this
‘Cause there is nothing higher
Than the lovers bliss, oh yeah

Lovers bliss, oh yeah
Lovers bliss, oh yeah
Lovers bliss, oh yeah

Lovers bliss, oh yeah
Lovers bliss, oh yeah
Lovers bliss, oh yeah

Lovers bliss
(Where ever we go)
(When ever we want to be together)

Where ever we go
When ever we want to be together
We wanna be together

Lovers bliss, oh yeah
Lovers bliss, oh yeah
Lovers bliss
