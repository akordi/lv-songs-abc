[Am] So she walks in[F]to a bar and talks 
[C] This and that, nice and slow 
[G] Here we go…. 
All [Am] eyes on her- a [F] stranger from the North 
[C] While she goes back and forth 
[G] Then she stops and pulls… 

[Am] Uh, ah, ah, ah, 
[F] uh, ah, ah, [C] uh. 
…a magic [G] string. Who is she? 

[Am] La la-la-la-Laura - she [F] said her name 
[C] Winked her eye, started [G] out the game 
[Am] La-la-la-la Laura the [F] banjo girl 
[C] Who was she? What did she [G] play? 

[Am] Just a glance, 
[F] Just a little dance - 
[C] Blows our minds right away 
[G] As she starts to [Am] sway 
And spin - 
[F] Girl from out-of-town. 
[C] Clubbers jump up and down 
[G] She goes on and pulls...

[Am] Uh, ah, ah, ah, 
[F] uh, ah, ah, [C] uh. 
…a magic [G] string. Who is she? 

[Am] La la-la-la-Laura - she [F] said her name 
[C] Winked her eye, started [G] out the game 
[Am] La-la-la-la Laura the [F] banjo girl 
[C] Who was she? What did she [G] play?
