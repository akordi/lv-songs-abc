And [C] I don't know if [F] I can do
[G] Anything with[C]out you
And [C] I don't know if [F] I can do
[G] Anything at [C] all

[Am] I got nothing left to [F] do
For [C] you, my [G] love
And [Am] I got nothing left to [F] say
To [C] you, my [G] love

And [C] I don't know if [F] I can do
[G] Anything with[C]out you
And [C] I don't know if [F] I can do
[G] Anything at [C] all

And now we [F] sleep tight on the [G] beachside
Pretending [Am] that we're just fine [C]
And now we [F] sleep tight on the [G] beachside
Pretending [Am] that we're just fine [C]

[Am] I have bet every[F]thing
On our [C] love, I can't rise [G] above
And [Am] now I'm sure that I can't [F] do
Any[C]thing about [G] you

And [C] I don't know if [F] I can do
[G] Anything with[C]out you
And [C] I don't know if [F] I can do
[G] Anything at [C] all

And now we [F] sleep tight on the [G] beachside
Pretending [Am] that we're just fine [C]
And now we [F] sleep tight on the [G] beachside
Pretending [Am] that we're just fine [C]
