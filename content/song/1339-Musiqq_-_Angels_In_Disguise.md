Intro:  Am7 | C | G | Dm7

Am7            C                 G
Woke up tonight, looked at the moon,
          Dm7                 Am7
Blinding light filled up my room.
              C                G
Looked to my right – my better half,
           Dm7                  Am7
And it’s alright, if it’s all I have,
          C             G
I let it ride, I’m satisfied,
Just be mine.

Chorus:
                        Am
     Kill me with killa kiss,
                           C
     Kill me with tempting lips,
                            G
     Stare at me with candy eyes,
                           Dm7
     Love me with luscious thighs.

                        Am
     Kill me with killa kiss,
                           C
     Kill me with tempting lips,
                            G
     Stare at me with candy eyes,
                           Dm7
     Love me with luscious thighs.

                 Am     C  G Dm7
     Angel in disguise,
                 Am     C  G Dm7
     Angel in disguise.

Not a day goes by, not without you
Crossing my mind, if you only knew.
Keep hope alive, I have faith in you,
Two worlds collide, honest and true.
You’re my lullaby, passion for life,
My starlit night.

Chorus:
     Kill me with killa kiss,
     Kill me with tempting lips,
     Stare at me with candy eyes,
     Love me with luscious thighs.

     Kill me with killa kiss,
     Kill me with tempting lips,
     Stare at me with candy eyes,
     Love me with luscious thighs.

     Angel in disguise,
     Angel in disguise.

        Am
   It’s simple, like you and I
        C
   Just spread your wings and learn to fly.
 Dm7
   I must be one lucky guy
          Am
   With a girl like you right by my side.

 Am
   No sweat, imma do this right,
   C
   Bring the moon to the moonless sky.
 G
   Yeah, I see – the stakes are high,
            Dm7
   But this story ends with no goodbye.

 Am
   Girl, I’m qualified,
     C
   I get what I see, no need to try,
 G
   I’ll make sure your dream will never die.

Chorus:
     Kill me with killa kiss,
     Kill me with tempting lips,
     Stare at me with candy eyes,
     Love me with luscious thighs.

     Kill me with killa kiss,
     Kill me with tempting lips,
     Stare at me with candy eyes,
     Love me with luscious thighs.

     Angel in disguise,
     Angel in disguise.

                           Cadd9  G Dm7
     Spread your wings and fly...
