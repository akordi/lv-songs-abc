Riches and splendor, busy agendas
Fancy cars, glamorous bars, superstars
Usually escorted by emotional bankruptcy
It starts out in the family

Spouses disconnected, children neglected
Shop as a cure, liquor store, give me more
LGBT, the disabled and homeless
Don’t you think our shade leaves them pretty hopeless?

Who is in charge up in this mess?
Do we have a chance to work things out?
Who is in charge of all this mess?
Give us a chance to make things right now

Values always changing
God, which do you believe in?
Iron doors, violent force, religious wars
Money and laws, do they serve a good cause only?
Now tell me

Who is in charge of all this mess?
Do we have a chance to make things right, yeah?
Who is in charge of all this mess?
Give us a chance to make things better

Overproduction, starvation, glamour, no water
Impatience, delusion, confusion
All the lost souls, single mamas and old men
We have the way to make their days golden

We are in charge, we’re not dismissed
We have a chance to make things better
Every day on every step
We have a choice to change it forever

We are in charge, we’re not dismissed
We have a chance to make things better
Every day on every step
We have a choice to change it forever
