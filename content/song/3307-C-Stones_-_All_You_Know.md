Let’s go!
Hey everybody, time’s up, we’re here,
C-Stones, come on!

All we’re hearing and all we say
Now, then and everyday,
You, you get up, up and up you find, yeah,
That different standing downward sign.

All you know is endless love there above,
You’ve said so,
As you go and search for more forbidden doors,
You’ve said so.

Oh baby, and you will live forever,
Oh baby, if you want it,
Oh baby, and I will give you all that,
Oh baby, what do you feel and all you want.

Tell me where you are,
Are hiding your deep thoughts,
Tell me why did you go,
Now I wanna cry out.

Get me out of your heart,
It’s getting, getting too hard,
Let me back up and start,
And I will keep hoping on.

All you know is endless love there above,
You’ve said so,
As you go and search for more forbidden doors,
You’ve said so.

Oh baby, and you will live forever,
Oh baby, if you want it,
Oh baby, and I will give you all that,
Oh baby, what do you feel and all you want.

Oh baby, and you will live forever,
Oh baby, if you want it,
Oh baby, and I will give you all that,
Oh baby, what do you feel and all you want.

(Oh baby) Everybody loves somebody,
Everyone kind of wants it started.
(Oh baby) Can you feel love in the air?
Time’s up and we are here.

(Oh baby) Everybody loves somebody,
Everyone kind of wants it started.
(Oh baby) Can you feel love in the air?
Time’s up and we are here.

Hey everybody, time’s up, we’re here,
Time’s up and we are here.

Oh baby!
