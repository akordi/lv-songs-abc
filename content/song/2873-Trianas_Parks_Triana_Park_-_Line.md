```text
I’m going [F] round in [Em] circles
And the [Am] door’s wide [G] open
Boy I [F] still wanna see [Em] you
Days go [Am] by, I’m still hoping, [G] hoping

  [F] Where we draw the line?
  [Em] Tell me, baby, [Am] where we draw the line?
  [G] Tell me, baby, [F] where we draw the line?
  [Em] Tell me, baby, [Am] where we draw the line?

You [F] told me to move [Em] on
Searching [Am] now for somebody else
But baby, [G] tell me [F] how will I find [Em] it?
If [Am] all I see is you? [G] All I see is you?

[F] All I see is you, all I see
[Am] All I see is you, all I see

  [F] Where we draw the line?
  [Em] Tell me, baby, [Am] where we draw the line?
  [G] Tell me, baby, [F] where we draw the line?
  [Em] Tell me, baby, [Am] where we draw the line?

My [Dm] heart breaks to see [F] you,
[Em] Days go by, [Am] I’m still hoping

[F] All I see is you, all I see
[Am] All I see is you, all I see

  [F] Where we draw the line?
  [Em] Tell me, baby, [Am] where we draw the line?
  [G] Tell me, baby, [F] where we draw the line?
  [Em] Tell me, baby, [Am] where we draw the line?
