[Am] I know you told
So many times
[Am] So many words
In different rhymes
But [D] i don’t [F] feel the [G] same

[Am] I wasn’t innocent, i know
[Am] And things i did for sure were wrong
The [D] time has [F] passed so [G] long

  Feeling your [Am] heartbeat
  Thats what i [C] want
  Thats what i [G] need
  Feeling again that youre breathing with [Am] me 

[Am] I’m getting wild when i’m alone
[Am] I learned by heart youre not my own
But [D] i never [F] asked you to be[G]long

[Am] Your my desire and my pain
[Am] But all the battles are in vain
You [D] mean more [F] than anything to [G] me

  Feeling your [Am] heartbeat
  Thats what i [C] want
  Thats what i [G] need
  Feeling again that youre breathing with [Am] me 

  Feeling your [Am] heartbeat
  Thats what i [C] want
  Thats what i [G] need
  Feeling again that youre breathing with [Am] me 

[D] You’re the one i need
You’re the [F] air that i breath
[D] Don’t throw my heart away
I want you to [E] stay

  Feeling your [Am] heartbeat
  Thats what i [C] want
  Thats what i [G] need
  Feeling again that youre breathing with [Am] me 

  Feeling your [Am] heartbeat
  Thats what i [C] want
  Thats what i [G] need
  Feeling again that youre breathing with [Am] me 

  Feeling your [Am] heartbeat
