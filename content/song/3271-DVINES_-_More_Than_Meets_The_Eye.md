```text
Wind has blown a foreign sand
I heard a voice from a distant land
It told me

You don’t know how far you’d go
You can make the oceans dry
Make the sun go blue and catch the moon
You’re more than meets the eye

More than meets the eye
More than meets the eye

It told me to go
Look for sun in the rain
Search for stars in the dust
And learn love from the pain
It told me

You don’t know how far you’d go
You can make the oceans dry
Make the sun go blue and catch the moon
You’re more than meets the eye

More than meets the eye
More than meets the eye

Cos you are more than meets the eye
More than meets the eye
Cos you are more than meets the eye
More than meets the eye

You are more than meets the eye
You are more than meets the eye
You are more than meets the eye
You are more than meets the eye

More than meets the, more than meets the eye
More than meets the, more than meets the eye

You are more than you know, you are more than you think
And soon you will learn that you are more than
You are more than you know, you are more than you think
And soon you will learn that you are more than

More than meets the eye
