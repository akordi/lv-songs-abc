I don’t want to look around,
I want to do a daily round,
I want singing, what I feel,
Don’t think so much, come to heal.

You can sing this angel’s song,
You can hear it all day long,
I’m yours, every inch,
Within your reach.

To the best of my memory
Angel’s songs singing finally
To the best of my memory.

Angel’s eyes seeing finally
To the best of my memory,
Memory.

Don’t shoot my angels, don’t shoot!
Angels call really, angels are really.
Don’t shoot my angels, don’t shoot!
Angels call really, angels call really.

This life is a music boat,
I’m always so mad about,
I’m afraid I’m in for it,
Angels´ wise, wiser than me.

Let’s do singing under the sun,
It’s out of the common run,
Music to address the sky,
Angel’s song fly.

To the best of my memory
Angel’s songs singing finally
To the best of my memory.

Angel’s eyes seeing finally
To the best of my memory,
Memory.

Don’t shoot my angels, don’t shoot!
Angels call really, angels are really.
Don’t shoot my angels, don’t shoot!
Angels call really, angels call really.

Don’t shoot my angels, don’t shoot (don’t shoot)!
Angels call really, angels are really.
Don’t shoot my angels, don’t shoot (don’t shoot)!
Angels call really, angels call really.
