```text
Spending every minute of the night
Thinking what we did and what we had
Every second counts this time
Going up at the speed of light

Although I’m stuck
Although I’m lost

We fall in love with an open heart
You saw every teardrop running down my face
Chased the shadows until morning came
Were ever you are, I will find you

Shooting at the brightest stars tonight
(And) Saying words that could mean so much
Every time I close my eyes
I´m going up at the speed of light
Although it`s wrong
Although it´s love?

And every second of the day
No matter how long I will stay
Every single time I follow
No matter how long you will go
```
