Intro: Em Am7 C Am D

 Em                            Am7
I was gonna walk deep into the night
 Em                            Am7
For a 100 miles till I see the light
 Em
You can read my mind
Am7
I can see your soul
 C
We are so alike
                       Am        D
Like fish in a little bowl (yeah)

Time, what if I could give you mine
                      Am     C
Would it be enough to shine
             G
I’d give it all

A little coffee cup of yours

Can it work it’s magic
 Em                            Am7
Can it bring us to the times before

Man was just a boy, lady was a girl

Does it have to change
 Am
The way we see the world

We are so alike
