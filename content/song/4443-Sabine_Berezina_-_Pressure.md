```text
1.Hear this song and you
Will believe me
There is nothing to hide
Take my hand and then
You will follow me
We can leave all behind
2.We will carry on
Possibility
And together go on
Just imagine that we are like birds
Take a run and lets fly
...higher than the birds are flying
...higher than the planes are  going
...Higher than the stars are shining
Better and better we (are)
Flying eternaly and live forever

Piedziedajums.

Heaven
can be reality
World without gravity,
Place that is not yet for us
But that place is not yet for us
3.Many mysteries that people still don't know
But they always survive
Soon and suddenly
They will realizeThat is better to ride
....farther than horses are running
.....farther than the cars are driving
.....farther than the ships are going sailing
Better and better we are driving away
And living in our way.
Bridge...Come to me closer and look into my eyes you 
will see what inside, they dont know lie
Only love is around and together we (are) narrow minded 
(,) you and i, still you and i
