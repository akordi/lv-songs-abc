```text
I wanted to believe you were my destiny
That I caught a shooting star by its tail

Three words and I would fall
Three words but you are gone
Three words you never said

You know my heart belongs to you
But you never said “I do”
We could hold the stars
But you hold us apart

I don’t get it, why not do it?
Why you can’t? Just remember
Pictures, places, things we’ve done

Three words and I would fall
Three words but you are gone
Three words you never said

You know my heart belongs to you
But you never said “I do”
We could hold the stars
But you hold us apart

You know my heart belongs to you
But you never said “I do”
We could hold the stars
But you hold us apart

You know my heart belongs to you
But you never said “I do”
We could hold the stars
But you hold us apart

You know my heart belongs to you
But you never said “I do”
We could hold the stars
But you hold us apart

You never did believe
Fairytales could be real
But now I’m like a fool
Still holding stars for you
