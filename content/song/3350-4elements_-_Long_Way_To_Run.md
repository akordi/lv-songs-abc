Who was near me
To get me over all the fear?
Nice look (just look at you), sweet face (isn’t it sweet),
But all the senses now gets me through as always,
It’s not an ordinary me.

And I don’t talk like everybody,
It’s me: Myself for everyone.
As long as you keep dream´ about me,
Be the one,
Come clean and say the words I’ve heard before.

I know who was
The one who let my senses free.
Your look (just look at you), your face (isn’t it sweet),
But all the senses now gets me through as always,
It’s not an ordinary me.

And I don’t talk like everybody,
It’s me: Myself for everyone.
As long as you keep dream´ about me,
Be the one,
Come clean and say the words I’ve heard before.

Stay in, escape yourself is not so easy,
Way out, long way out.

(Long way to run,
Long way to run,
Long way to run,
Long way to run.)

(Long way to run)
And I don’t talk like everybody,
(Long way to run)
It’s me: Myself for everyone.
(Long way to run)
As long as you keep dream´ about me.
