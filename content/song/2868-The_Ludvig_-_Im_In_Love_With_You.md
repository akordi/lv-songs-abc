```text
[Am] It's late in the evening
[C] And I'm waiting for you
[Am] Soon I'll stop breathing
[C] And I blame it on the full moon

So [F] darling, please [G] believe I'm in love with [C] you 

[Am] Leave your shoes at the door
[C] I can't wait no more
[Am] We might be too young 
[C] But I think we're in love.

So [F] darling, please [G] believe I'm in love with [C] you

[F] Time flies by [G] your eyes
[Am] When I am with you I [C] feel alive
