Let’s fly away,
Fly away with you.

I had a dream of Puerto Rico,
Of having little fun.
I had a dream that I could find you,
My dream has just begun, just begun.

I want to fly away to the Mexican coast,
I want to fly away when nobody knows,
I want to fly away with the dream of my soul,
I want to fly away with you.

Let’s fly away,
Fly away with you.

See the stars of September,
See the falling leaves.
It’s not hard to remember
How I fall indeed in dream that I need.

I want to fly away to the Mexican coast,
I want to fly away when nobody knows,
I want to fly away with the dream of my soul,
I want to fly away with you.

Fly with you
Is everything I deserve to do,
Fly with you,
With the dream of my heart for you, for you.

Hoohoohoo …

I want to fly away,
I want to fly away,
(I want to fly away) with you.

I want to fly away to the Mexican coast,
I want to fly away when nobody knows,
I want to fly away with the dream of my soul,
I want to fly away with you.

I want to fly away to the Mexican coast,
I want to fly away when nobody knows,
I want to fly away with the dream of my soul,
I want to fly away with you.

I want to fly away with you.
