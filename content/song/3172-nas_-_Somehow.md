```text
You're standing on that bridge
Between the false and truth to jump or not
To stay or leave or what

Life seems like peace of shit
With all those promises
They say it will be better
Much better so where it is

I just simply can't take it anymore we have to
Brake them, shake them and save the world somehow

That day we will be as one
That day all pain will be gone

That day we will be as one
That day all pain will be gone you're rights

Our father in the sky
You made world beautiful
With gentle breath trough shining seas with love

You can say probably
Life is a misery
But I know we got a soul, soul and that is truth

Don't be afraid there is a guiding light we have to
Learn it, share it and find the way somehow

That day we will be as one
That day all pain will be gone

That day we will be as one
That day all pain will be gone

That day we will be as one
That day all pain will be gone

That day we will be as one
That day all pain will be gone

Long, long time ago one great man said to be or not
To be it's our destiny 21 century, we're living free
But still this question stand's for all humanity

That day we will be as one
That day all pain will be gone

That day we will be as one
That day all pain will be gone

That day we will be as one
That day all pain will be gone

That day we will be as one
That day all pain will be gone yeah

You can trust yourself
Believe yourself, believe yourself, 'cause you got a soul, you got a soul
I know it and we know it... Somehow
