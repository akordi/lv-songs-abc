```text
you're standing on that bridge.
between the false and truth. to jump or not
to stay or leave..or what

life seems like peace of shit.
with all those promises.
they say it will be better.
much better ..so where it is

* I just simply can't take it anymore . we have to 
brake them, shake them and save the world .... somehow .

  that day we will be as one.
  that day all pain will be gone

  that day we will be as one.
  that day all pain will be gone

our father in the sky.
you made world beautiful.
with gentle breath trough shining seas. with love

you can say probably.
life is a misery
but I know we got a soul, soul and that is truth ..

* don't be afraid there is a guiding light. we have to 
learn it, share it and find the way .... somehow.

  that day we will be as one.
  that day all pain will be gone   4x

long, long time ago. one great man said. to be or not 
to be. it's our destiny. 21 century, we're living free. 
but still this question stand's for all humanity ..

  that day we will be as one.
  that day all pain will be gone   4x

You can trust yourself
believe in yourself, believe in yourself . 'cause You got 
a soul, You got a soul .. I know it, I know it ... Somehow
