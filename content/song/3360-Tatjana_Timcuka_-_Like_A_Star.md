Everything that we’ve been coming through,
Everything that I have done for you,
Everything our love was meant to be,
Baby, I will take it all with me.

Every time you took my breath away,
Every night with you and every day,
I’ll keep it always in my heart,
And I wanna thank you, babe, for that.

Like a star in the sky
Love still shines when it’s die,
Now it’s time to break free,
I just want to be me.

Like a star in the sky
Love may shine when it’s die,
Now it’s time to break free,
I just want to be me, I just want to be me.

I don’t know if we can meet again,
I don’t know if we can be just friends,
I just wanna kiss and hold you tight,
And I wanna stay with you tonight.

I believe in rainbow in the sky,
I believe true love will never die,
I’ll keep it always in my heart,
And I wanna thank you, babe, for that.

Like a star in the sky
Love still shines when it’s die,
Now it’s time to break free,
I just want to be me.

Like a star in the sky
Love may shine when it’s die,
Now it’s time to break free,
I just want to be me, I just want to be me.

I just want to be me.

Hahahaha,
Hahahahahaha.

Like a star in the sky (like a star in the sky)
Love still shines when it’s die (love still shines when it’s die),
Now it’s time to break free (now it’s time to break free),
I just want to be me (I just want to be me).

Like a star in the sky (like a star in the sky)
Love may shine when it’s die (love may shine when it’s die),
Now it’s time to break free (now it’s time to break free),
I just want to be me, I just want to be me.
