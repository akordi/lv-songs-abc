ONLINE

    Am
I'm reading your letters
    F
I hope you are mine 
      G/C                  F/C             
You say that you're always fine, 
            Am                F        G/C    F/C
But if you feel sad you can reach me online 


I hope you are better, 
I'll meet you at nine 
You will say that you're always fine 
But if you still feel sad you can reach me online 

And you and you and you 
Too many passwords, codes and gateways to reach you 
And every time I search that's true, it's even easier to find U2 than the real U 
W, W....too much trouble, I would say even double 
And finally I can't understand it at all
I see the biggest screen without you on my wall

I'm reading your letters I hope you are mine 
You say that you're always fine, 
But if you feel sad you can reach me online

I hope you are better, I'll meet you at nine 
You will say that you're always fine 
But if you still feel sad you can reach me online

E   Am                 G                              C
            Will you come with me to that place
E   Am                    G                         C
            Where heaven meens the sea 
E   Am                  G                         C
             We'll be standing face to face 
E    Am                        G                                     Am
              No mobile phones, so free, so free, so free....

Am
And you and you and you 
                            F                         G/C                    F/C
What would you say if someone comes to you and asks 
Am 
"What is Your favourite dream?", 
F                                             G/C                   F/C
...and I would answer - "to see HER on my screen"


"All right", he would say, "then find a real password - a key to her heart, 
Its not too simple, it's not too smart", and then 
Your dream will be saved forever...

I'm reading your letters 
I hope you are mine
You say that you're always fine, 
But if you feel sad you can reach me online

I hope you are better, 
I'll meet you at nine 
You will say that you're always fine 
But if you still feel sad you can reach me online
