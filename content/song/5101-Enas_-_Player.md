[1. VERSE]
When the skull and there is no place to go
Sound of broken glass, but time will you?
Taking all your and my differences
So player number one takes it up
There's no time for any mistakes

[1. Chorus]
And only God knows what he may sell (sell)
Play the game (play the game) without troubles
Go away (go away) silent letter
Play the game (play the game) without rules
Go away (go away) silently

[2. VERSE]
Imagine all those things that you can't deny
Burning through my fingertips
After some time, we have no place to go
And our life is just a game. Hey, man
There is no time for any mistakes

[2. Chorus]
And only God knows what he may sell (sell)
Play the game (play the game) without rules
Go away (go away) silent lair
Play the game (play the game) without rules
Go away (go away) silence let

[1. BRIDGE]
All the time
Eldes live all the time
All the time
In this life all the time (all the time, all the time)
All the time in this life (all the time, all the time)
All the time in this life all the time
Play the game

There is hope for you today to be some other not the same
Spread your wings and fly away
There is one key for you to play heart to heart
Don't be afraid you nearly miss, but don't feel shamed
Eyes never lie (eyes never lie) they always tell them why
Heartbeats to sing (heartbeats to sing), but still there's something strange

[3. Chorus]
Open your eyes the saddest rising new day for changing something
Live this day like there's no other days
Open your eyes the sun is rising new day for changing something
Live this day like there's no other days (no other day)

[2. BRIDGE]
No way
[2. Instrumental]

[4. VERSE]
World is turning all the time, just being happy
It's not a crying love there is a butterfly
There is a ground beneath the feet
Draw a wrong step and you're going deep, remember? So let's watch you need a

[4. Chorus]
Eyes never lie (eyes never lie)
They always tell them while
Heartbeats to sane (heartbeats to sane), but still there's something strange
Open your eyes the sun is rising beautiful changing something
Live this day like there's no other day
Open your eyes the sun is rising beautiful changing something
Live this day like there's no other days (no other day)
Like there's no other day (other day)
[3. instrumental]

[3. BRIDGE]
You're gonna love this day
Love it there's no other day
