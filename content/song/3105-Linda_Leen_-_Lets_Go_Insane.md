There’s a place I used to know
It was all so beautiful
It was only for me and you

Would you come into my place?
Would you go into my shoes?
Would you stand the hard embrace?

When I give my heart
When I fall in love
It will be the same

Baby, baby, I wanna be your star
Let me hide and fall in your sky
Don’t wanna hurt you, it is true
I just wanna love you
Come in to my life and, baby, let’s go insane

Lay your body next to mine
Feel the ground and heaven above
Hear the sound of my soul

I don’t wanna fight no more
I don’t want you to lie
Don’t want me to cry, don’t wanna hide

When I give my heart
When I fall in love
It will be the same

Baby, baby, I wanna be your star
Let me hide and fall in your sky
Don’t wanna hurt you, it is true
I just wanna love you
Come in to my life and, baby

It is true
Love you

Don’t wanna hurt you, it is true
I just wanna love you
Come in to my life and, baby
Let’s go insane

Baby, baby, I wanna be your star
Let me hide and fall in your sky
Don’t wanna hurt you, it is true
I just wanna love you
Come in to my life and, baby, let’s go insane
