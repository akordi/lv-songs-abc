```text
Tell me why I can't get you out of my head
Tell me how far we'll go and where will we end

Know that you're the problem
The reason I cannot sleep at night
Cause I think about you just like a prisoner
It's about freedom

  I'm on fire
  From your a-a-arms
  A-a-my desire
  Burns me out

From the first moment
By the time that we're at
I'll miss all the things that we almost had
Woo-o-o-o-o-o

Know that you're the problem
The reason I cannot sleep at night
Would you like to come into reason
Would that be wrong or right
Alright
 
  I'm on fire
  From your a-a-arms
  A-a-my desire
  Burns me a-a-out
  A-a-I'm on fire
  From your a-a-arms
  A-a-my desire
  Burns me out

(From your arms)
(Burns me out)

  I'm on fire
  I'm on fire
  My desire
  Burns me a-a-out
  A-a-I'm on fire
