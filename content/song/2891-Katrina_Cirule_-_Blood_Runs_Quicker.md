```text
Tryna find good out of everything i do
When there’s a negative it always involves you
In my chest tryna break through 
No need to hide it
No need to hide it’s true

Don’t bring me down
Spread across the ground
Hoping that you’ll fix me

  I know you’re bad for me babe
  But my heart still flickers
  How can i run from you babe
  When my blood runs quicker

I’m tryna repair the mess
That we’re made
But it’s hard to be positive
When all we ever do is hate
You’re in my head screaming my name
I’m not gonna lie
I’ve been trying to let you fade

so
Don’t bring me down
Spread across the ground
Hoping that you’ll fix me

  I know you’re bad for me babe
  But my heart still flickers
  How can i run from you babe
  When my blood runs quicker
