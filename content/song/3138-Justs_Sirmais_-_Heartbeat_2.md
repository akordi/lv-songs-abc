Am
I know you told
So many times
Am
So many words
In different rhymes
   Dm        C        G
But I don’t feel the same

Am
I wasn’t innocent, I know
Am
And things I did for sure were wrong
   Dm         C         G
The time has passed so long

            Am
Feeling your heartbeat
             C
That's what I want
             G
That's what I need
                                       Am
Feeling again that you're breathing with me

Am
I’m getting wild when I’m alone
Am
I learned by heart you're not my own
   D       C                Am
But I never asked you to be long

Am
Your my desire and my pain
Am
But all the battles are in vain
   D        C                G
You mean more than anything to me

            Am
Feeling your heartbeat
             C
That's what I want
             G
That's what I need
                                        Am
Feeling again that you're breathing with me

             Am
Feeling your heartbeat
             C
That's what I want
             G
That's what I need
                                        Am
Feeling again that you're breathing with me

F
You’re the one I need
          Am
You’re the air that I breathe
C
Don’t throw my heart away
             G
I want you to stay

            Am
Feeling your heartbeat
             C
That's what I want
             G
That's what I need
                                        Am
Feeling again that you're breathing with me

            Am
Feeling your heartbeat
             C
That's what I want
             G
That's what I need
                                        Am
Feeling again that you're breathing with me
            Am
Feeling your heartbeat
