```text
I found myself under neon lights
When your venom kicked in
I had no intentions to sin
But you've got me compromised
I'm roaming the streets of this town
Recreating the image of you

So start the fire
Because I want to burn
So carelessly
I walked my body in the range of your gravity
Baby can you feel
The love I'm sending to you with the paper planes
So start the fire

You are burning inside my veins
Infiltrating my soul
Turning into voices inside my head
They're telling me
To get you by my side
With every sip I take my need of you grows stronger

I cannot resist you
You're everything I see
These city lights know you are
The only thing I want
Bring it on, take me
Into your loving arms
Let this night breathe you into me

Breathe you in me

So start the fire
Because I want to burn
So carelessly
I walked my body in the range of your gravity
Baby can you feel
The love I'm sending to you with the paper planes
