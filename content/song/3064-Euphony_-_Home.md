There are so many places around the world to see
There are so many people to meet, but only she knows how
Knows how to make me feel like I am home

There are so many colours and blinding lights to see
So beautiful and gracious, you know but only she knows how
Knows how to make me feel like I am home

Thank you for the life you gave me with your heart
Thank you for your love
Finally I feel like I can really start
Spread my wings and fly above my fears

There are so many chances to take, but I’m not sure
Of disappointment later and what it’s really for, but she
Knows how to make me feel like I am home, home
Feels like I’m home and I’m home

Thank you for the life you gave me with your heart
Thank you for your love
Finally I feel like I can really start
Spread my wings and fly above

Time goes by but there’s no place I’d rather be
And I hope I found a decent melody
For the song to describe how I feel
About you, about love, about family

Thank you for the life you gave me with your heart
Thank you for your love (Thank you for your love)
I can feel it’s time
Spread my wings and fly above my fears
