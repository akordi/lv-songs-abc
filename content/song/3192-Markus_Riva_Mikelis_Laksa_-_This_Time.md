```text
Won't make it right 
This time
No

Keep telling me you're sorry
I guess I should believe it
Cause I never thought I'd see
The day you leave me
Saying that you love me
I wanna believe it
But that's what makes it hard for me
And I don't see no other way
You can lie now
Go ahead and try now
Just look me in my face
And take the trust away

There you go telling me one more lie
There you go looking me in my eyes
Like you do
I'm so through

Cause every time you lie
I thought we can make this right
Should I learn from the last time
And every single time
We gave love a try
You remind me why
I had to say goodbye
But that won't make it right 
This time

You said that you get it then
You go and do it all over again
You won't make me believe you're sorry
How am I supposed to let it go
Too late to take it slow
We're so far from where we started

There you go telling me one more lie
There you go looking me in my eyes
Like you do
I'm so through

Cause every time you lie
I thought we can make this right
Should I learn from the last time
And every single time
We gave love a try
You remind me why
I had to say goodbye

Go ahead lie to me
I hear you saying
I need you
Baby girl just lie
But before you lie to me
Can you make it so good I believe it
Before you start to cry

There you go telling me one more lie
There you go looking me in my eyes
Like you do
I'm so through

Cause every time you lie
I thought we can make this right
Should I learn from the last time
And every single time
We gave love a try
You remind me why
I had to say goodbye
But that won't make it right 
This time
But that won't make it right
No
But that won't make it right
This time
But that won't make it right
No

But that won't make it right
This time
