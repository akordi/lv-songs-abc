Baby, I am so lost in this labyrinth
I don’t know where is the way out of here
Another animals would get lost in here
They’d rather travel back to the stratosphere

It’s another planet that is taking control over us
Where to hide, where to go, is this even real life?
It’s another planet that is taking control over us
Where to hide, where to go, is this even real life?

I just go right and left
I don’t know how to escape this real life
It is your problem that I’m trapped in here forever
How do I escape? Baby, please tell me

I just go right and left
I don’t know how to escape this real life
It is your problem that I’m trapped in here forever
How do I escape? Baby, please tell me

It is my escape
Baby, please help me, baby, please help me
I walk to the left going right into the sky
It is so dark here, I cannot make up my mind

On this planet there are so many possibilities
But we’re just a puppet show in the humilities

It’s another planet that is taking control over us
Where to hide, where to go, is this even real life?
It’s another planet that is taking control over us
Where to hide, where to go, is this even real life?

I just go right and left
I don’t know how to escape this real life
It is your problem that I’m trapped in here forever
How do I escape? Baby, please tell me

I just go right and left
I don’t know how to escape this real life
It is your problem that I’m trapped in here forever
Forever

It’s another planet that is taking control over us
Where to hide, where to go, is this even real life?
It’s another planet that is taking control over us
Where to hide, where to go, is this even real life?
