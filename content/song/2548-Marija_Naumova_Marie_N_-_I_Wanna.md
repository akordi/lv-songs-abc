[Am] I'd like to go away, but [E] it's easier to say 
That [A	m] you know all the tricks that make... that [E] make me stay 
[Am] I'm ready to support this [E] artful game you always play 
'Cause [Am] you don't know the fee that you will [E] later, later pay 

[F] Today you think you are the winner, [C] today you think you are the king 
You [E] make me sweat in my emotions under your flyway, flyway [Am] wing 

  I wanna be the [E] sunshine in your eyes, I wanna be the [Am] light from shooting stars 
  I wanna be [E] queen in your sweetest lies, I wanna be the [Am] love-spark in your eyes 
  I wanna be the [E] sunshine in your eyes, I wanna be the [Am] light from shooting stars 
  I wanna be [E] queen in your sweetest lies I wanna be the love-spark in your [Am] eyes

Ay ay ay ay ay ay... 

[Am] I like a simple game, but it's [E] just easier to say 
That [Am] you own all that rules your crazy, [E] crazy way 
And [Am] even though you'll go on doing [E] whatever... whatever you may 
[Am] Just remember - it's me who find you when... [E] when you was stray 

[F] Today you think you are the winner, [C] today you think you are the king 
You [E] make me sweat in my emotions under your flyway, flyway [Am] wing 

  I wanna be the [E] sunshine in your eyes, I wanna be the [Am] light from shooting stars 
  I wanna be [E] queen in your sweetest lies, I wanna be the [Am] love-spark in your eyes 
  I wanna be the [E] sunshine in your eyes, I wanna be the [Am] light from shooting stars 
  I wanna be [E] queen in your sweetest lies I wanna be the love-spark in your [Am] eyes

  I wanna be the [E] sunshine in your eyes, I wanna be the [Am] light from shooting stars 
  I wanna be [E] queen in your sweetest lies, I wanna be the [Am] love-spark in your eyes 
  I wanna be the [E] sunshine in your eyes, I wanna be the [Am] light from shooting stars 
  I wanna be [E] queen in your sweetest lies I wanna be the love-spark in your [Am] eyes
