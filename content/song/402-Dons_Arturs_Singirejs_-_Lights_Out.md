```text
D
Deep inside I know these million miles of road
Bm
are like our crashing zone
G
In the headlight, I roll you over
D
Maybe it's okay, to try another day
Bm
when there's nothing left to say
G
Away from you has become what's normal.

Em                      A
You act like you don't care
G                      F#
You say it's always been out me
G
and my priorities

D                     A
Lights out on never never
Bm                    G
Lights out on our forever
D           A            G
You will be my broken dream


The fire lost its flame, but no one is to blame
for bailing out on pain
I'm heading in a new direction
The walls must all come down
So I send them to the ground
and leave without a sound
Away from you has become what's normal
```
