 Am(sus2)----Em-------------------------F

With eagles' eyes which can’t see the light,
----------------G--------------------------------Am(sus2)

With a sin in hand, behind the back more ten.
They live and dream to see daybreak,
Fight for the life and are lost there.

 

           Am------------C-------------G------------D
           But we don't need to fight for the our freedom
           And we don’t need to die for the our love.
           Believe I know Who for you and me -
           Has already shed His holy Blood.

And wildness of days in darkness of years
Give birth to terror and frighten legends
And crowd dreams` ones` life away
They want to find a hidden answer.

They want to fly and they have wings
But now it the fashion is to clip.
They can not sleep, they quietly cry
They have dream, that dream could fly…

Bridge.: Em-F#-G-A
