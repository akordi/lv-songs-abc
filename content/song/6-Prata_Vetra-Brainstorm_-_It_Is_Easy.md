Em                    Bm
   Just like the sun
D                  A
   I tried to touch but it`s freezing
Em                    Bm
   You are my gun
D                  A
   You know, you can choot me, it`s easy


A      Em
Yeah...Hey...
D                    Bm
You wanted a star and i say it is easy

Yeah...


    Just like the flame
    But my fingers and hands are freezing
    You`re not the same
    I can feel it, you know, it`s so easy

Yeah...Hey...
You wanted a star and i say it is easy

       Hey...
To fly to the sun but i warn you it`s freezing


lalalalalalalalala
You wanted a star and i say it is easy

lalalalalalalalala
To fly to the sun but i warn you it`s freezing

lalalalalalalalala
Yeah... Just believe me it`s easy

lalalalalalalalala
Yeah... You know it is easy


    Caribbean blue - the eyes of my dancing angel
    Fire is cold for you my lovely stranger


Yeah...Hey...
You wanted a star and i say it is easy

Hey...
To fly to the sun but i warn you it`s freezing


lalalalalalalalala
You wanted a star and i say it is easy

lalalalalalalalala
To fly to the sun but i warn you it`s freezing

lalalalalalalalala
Yeah... Just believe me it`s easy

lalalalalalalalala
Yeah... You know it is easy
