```text
I know sometimes 
You try too hard
And you can push yourself too far
Beyond there is only sound

I send last goodbye 
To these walls that kept me inside
For so long I used to deny
All the love I had
Never got to fly

I’ll turn on my favorite song
And put it on repeat 
I’ll wear my favorite clothes
Lose myself in Midnight streets
People say it’s safe to stay 
When It’s time go out and play

Seems like I’ve been affected
And I can’t explain 
I just know that I 
Need to chase it down 

When it's hard to stay sober
And there is nothing left
to hold on to
All we wanna do 
is just to fall of 
from the earth 
All we want to do
Learn again to fly

I’ll turn on my favorite song
And put it on repeat 
I’ll wear my favorite clothes
Lose myself in Midnight streets
People say it’s safe to stay 
When It’s time Go out and play
And I let it go
