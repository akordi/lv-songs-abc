Gm
You bring
Gm/Bb
The light
Eb
To
           Cm7
My darkest side, babe.

Gm
The day,
Gm/Bb
The night
Eb
Split
            Cm7
To cure the sight, oh.

    Gm
You care,
       Gm/Bb
You animate,
             Eb
You guard me bare,
             Cm7
Bring up the heart rate.

     Gm
Your love
        F  Eb
Revives my soul
    F Bb
And I know
Bb
You'll choose it whole
 F  Eb  Cm7
Overall.

Gm
Your eye's a good mirror,
Gm/Bb
Look under the cover,
Eb
Love
         Cm7
Is above all.

    Gm
I'm safe
          Gm/Bb
Into your hands
            Eb
Let's move away
          Cm7
The edges expand.

     Gm
Your love
        F  Eb
Revives my soul
    F Bb
And I know
Bb
You'll choose it whole

            Gm
Show me the source of the light,
             Eb
I'm becoming affected,
           Gm
Seeing the glow of a white
               Eb
Is what I have detected.

         Gm
Feeling again, I'm alive,
                  Eb
It's your shining reflected.
       Gm
Love injected,
       Eb
Love injected.

     Gm
Your love
        F  Eb
Revives my soul
    F Bb
And I know
Bb
You'll choose it whole
