```text
Climb on board
Let me follow
Through the storm
Summer sorrow

On goes the river
Way down the mountain
Blood in veins
Silence surrounding

Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me

Why love's so high as summer sky
Why love's so high as summer sky

Go! It's a waterfall
Go! Let it flow through you
Go! It's a waterfall
Go! Let it flow

Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
