When nothing happens
As I’ve wanted
And life has struggled in
A place I shouldn’t be

I take my favourite ring
And put it on my finger
Just to be sure

If there exist any power
helping me recall
My strength

From earth and ground
Where my feet are
From earth and ground
Where my feet are

As I lay down
I smell the sweetness
Of thousand roses
Of thousand roses

As I lay down
I smell the sweetness
Of thousand roses
Of thousand roses

I found a letter
From a man
Who used to love me

I didn’t know
Much about it
But with look
Of grown eyes

I know it was, it was, it was
Love from heaven
Love from mirror of myself
Love from heaven
Love from getting out of hell

As I lay down
I smell the sweetness
Of thousand roses
Of thousand roses

As I lay down
I smell the sweetness
Of thousand roses
Of thousand roses

Uh, I know he loves me still
Uh, I know he loves me still, still

As I lay down
I smell the sweetness
As I lay down
I smell the sweetness

As I lay down
I smell the sweetness
Of thousand roses
Of thousand roses

As I lay down
I smell the sweetness
Of thousand roses
Of thousand roses

As I lay down
I smell the sweetness
Of thousand roses
Of thousand roses

As I lay down
I smell the sweetness
Of thousand roses
Of thousand roses
