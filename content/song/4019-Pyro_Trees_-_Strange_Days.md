Woke up this morning with a hole in my head
Some memories might be dead,
From the hole in my head

Could it just fade away?
(Lalalala, lalalala)
Just like that in one day?

Woke up this morning with a hole in my head
Maybe my morning is dead
From the hole in my head

Strange days, strange ways
(Strange days, strange ways)
Strange days, strange ways

Aaa-aaah...

I think I lost some memory of you
Somewhere along the way
You never come out, eh? But I saw you today
You never lift my head, but I saw you today

Strange days, strange ways
(Strange days, strange ways)
Strange days, strange ways



Aaa-aaah...

Aaa-aaah...



Strange
days, strange ways...
