```text
There was one boy
He thought that his
life will be easy
At least he hoped

As the days was
passing by
hours by hours
And minutes by minutes

The love was leaving him
Far away
Leaving him to suffer
Night after night

The boy needed love
To hold him tight
To feel the life

Something changes
He was stronger
And he understands the pain

He was Romeo
Romeo
Romeo without Juliet
Unfinished love

It was a stormy situation
When he thought
That the things were right
And something goes wrong

Oh



(Piedz)

This
is the story of my life
The book of my life
This is the story of my life
Oh,but the story doesn't end

She was out of his life
For nothing
He was a cowboy in the
lonely desert now

He needed her for the rest of his life
This is the story about...

Something going on
Something moving on
Oh,but i don't know how
Cause he needed her now

(Piedz) (2v)
This is the story of my life
I want you in my life
This is the story of my life
My life

I guess we will never meet each other again
Again with love

(Piedz)(3v)
This is the story of my life
Oh yeah
This is the story of my life
And the story is told
