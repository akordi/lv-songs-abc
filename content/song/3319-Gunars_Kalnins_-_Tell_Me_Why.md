Tell me why
Tell me why

Oh, can you believe?
All you wanna have
I have for real

Can you believe?
Oh, can you believe?
All we really, really need
Is to stand there for real

You, you are my angel
Living in my room

Tell me why, oh why
You have never let me fly?
Tell me why, oh why?
You can tell me why

Tell me why, oh why
You have never let me fly?
Tell me why, oh why?
Tell me why?

Oh, can you believe?
All you wanna do
I do it for real

Oh, can you believe
Oh, can you believe
Our dream is, is over
Now tell me, tell me
How do you feel?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah….

You, you are my angel
Living in my room

Tell me why, oh why
You have never let me fly?
(You have never, why?)
Tell me why, oh why?
You can tell me why

Tell me why, oh why
You have never let me fly?
(You have never let me fly)
Tell me why, oh why?
Tell me why?

You’ve had never let me fly
For real, for real, for real
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah…

You, you are my angel
Living in my room

Tell me why, oh why
You have never let me fly?
(You have never, why?)
Tell me why, oh why?
You can tell me why

Tell me why, oh why
You have never let me fly?
(You have never let me fly)
Tell me why, oh why?
Tell me why?
