What I had with you
I have with nobody
Lost my wings without you
Lost my wings 
Without you

I tried to forget your name
Erase but it's all the same
Girl seems that I can't get enough of you
I'll take all the blame
If you want me to

My senses are paralyzed
I'm acting like mesmerized
Another poison to blur my mind
Can't remember what was last night
I see what I want
Pretend I'm blind

What I had with you
I have with nobody
Lost my wings without you
Lost my wings 
Without you

What I had with you
I have with nobody
Lost my wings without you
Lost my wings 
Without you

No chances for compromise
'Cause you killed me
With plotted lies
Shot right through my heart
With no bullets left
How could I remain?

You left me barely breathing
Barely breathing
Barely breathing
Barely breathing
Barely breathing
Barely breathing
Barely breathing

I wish we could go back in time
Before the day
When everything we had
Was burned alive

What I had with you
I have with nobody
Lost my wings without you
Lost my wings 
Without you

What I had with you
I have with nobody
Lost my wings without you
Lost my wings 
Without you
