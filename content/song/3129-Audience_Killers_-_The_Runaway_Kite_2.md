C#m    E              A           B
I remember you were a stranger once
       C#m     E      A        B
In a grey world where we belong
C#m      E              A         B
You were standing right next to me
     C#m         E         A        B
In a different place with many trees

    F#m                        A
She changed my world with the blink of an eye
C#m                    E
That is something I can't deny
F#m     A      E
Baby, baby
B
We live in a grey world

C#m  E  A  B
C#m  E  A  B

C#m        E          A             B
A little girl drew hearts in the sand
       C#m    E    A       B
On the beachside hand in hand
C#m        E        A           B
As fast as I can I run from here
C#m   E  A        B
Any time of the year

F#m

    F#m                        A
She changed my world with the blink of an eye
C#m                    E
That is something I can't deny
F#m     A      E
Baby, baby
B
We live in a grey world

G#m                 C#m
We live in a grey world
G#m
We live in a grey world

    F#m                        A
She changed my world with the blink of an eye
C#m                    E
That is something I can't deny
F#m     A      E
Baby, baby
B
We live in a grey world
