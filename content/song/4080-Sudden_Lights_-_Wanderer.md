```text
i feel like a wanderer above sea of fog
when sun goes down in line of horizont
i feel like a wanderer above sea of fog
my feet are heavy after long way home
oh was i Odyssey or just stray dog
now i need your hands to save me from next storm

and all the stars all the hills and milky way
are with me tonight but i feel lonely anyway
all the stars all the hills and milky way
are with me tonight but i still don't know what to say

i feel like a wanderer above sea of fog
my feet are cold after long way through snow
feelings come and feelings go 
like clouds we have no control

and all the stars all the hills and milky way
are with me tonight but i feel lonely anyway
all the stars all the hills and milky way
are with me tonight but i still don't know what to say

all the stars all the hills and milky way
are with me tonight but i still don't know what to say

and all the stars all the hills and milky way
are with me tonight but i feel lonely anyway
all the stars all the hills and milky way
are with me tonight but i still don't know what to say
