F Dm - C
My friends gonna call me: hey dreamer

Am Dm
The stars you are watching are so far

Bb C Am Dm
Tonight I know I will get there

Bb C
By plane or by bus - right to my star


[Same chords as before for next verse]:

Pretend there are things you just don't know
In spite someone's told you are so cute
You have to ask and I will show
The snow in the summer or so, so


F Bb C Am
If my star would fall, or disappear at all

Dm Bb Dm Bb
I will follow my star till the end of my days,

Dm Bb C F
And my heart's gonna lead me through so many ways,

Dm Bb Dm Bb
And if you gonna join me, I'll be your guide,

Dm Bb C F
Baby, 'never say never', be my 'Runaway bride'

[middle section - no vocals]:
Dm - Gm - C - F - Dm - Gm - C


[Next 2 verses & chorus: use same chords as previously]:

My friends gonna tell me: just calm down
The clouds you are walking are so high
This is my chance, and I'll invite
All the dreamers and lovers to fly (fly)..

I'm back from the future, life goes on,
But still I remember my promise
You have to ask and I will show
The snow in the summer or so, so

If my star would fall, or disappear at all,
I will follow my star till the end of my days,
And my heart's gonna lead me through so many ways,
And if you gonna join me I'll be your guide,
Baby, 'never say never', be my 'Runaway bride'
