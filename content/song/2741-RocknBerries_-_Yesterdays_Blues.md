Yesterday I got bad news 
I started to sing along my rhythm in blues 
Yesterday I got bad news 
I started to sing along my rhythm in blues  
Would you rock me babe? 
Would you rock when I am upside down? 
Would you rock  me babe? 
And start to sing along by my song when it goes:  
“Shoo-bee-doo, shoo-bee-doo-bee doo-bee-doo..”  
Yesterday I got bad news 
I started to drink along whiskey with juice, darling 
Yesterday I got bad news 
I started to drink along whiskey with juice  
Would you rock me babe? 
Would you rock when I am upside down? 
Would you rock me babe? 
And start to sing along by my song when it goes:  
“Shoo-bee-doo, shoo-bee-doo-bee doo-bee-doo..”  
Sometimes it feels the world is upside down 
But sometimes it feels the world is going down
