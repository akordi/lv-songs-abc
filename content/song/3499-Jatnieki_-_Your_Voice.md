```text
I heard your voice down the river
Something whisper in my heart
And every thought I real have this feeling
After all these years alone

I heard your voice down the river
Something whisper in my heart
Take my horse around you want mean it
To see what my heart wants to tell me so

And there you were shining back at me 
This moment is enough for me
And there I was standing front of you
I understanded it`s for real

With all your love you take my hands
No need to say now anything
I feel untangle everywhere
And thank God I`m here right now

And there you were shining back at me 
This moment is enough for me
And there I was standing front of you
I understanded it`s for real

And there you were shining back at me 
This moment is enough for me
And there I was standing front of you
I understaned it`s for real

And there you were shining back at me 
This moment is enough for me
And there I was standing front of you
I understaned it`s for real
