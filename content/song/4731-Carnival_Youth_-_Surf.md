[Intro: Dm C]

     Dm
you sneeze
                                    C
dandelion fluff flies through the air

and gets caught up in your hair
    Dm
we sleep sleep

by a fountain on a mountain
      C
baby please

let’s laugh until we’re dead

    Dm
we swim

and the water is warm

take it in

we can skip the part
          C
when it’s dark

cos we will never die


   Dm
we drink

wine from flowers

pour it in

you get super powers
     C
this night is ours

countless hours

of good good good good times


    Dm
you sneeze
                                  C
dandelion fluff flies through the air

and gets caught up in your hair
   Dm
we sleep

by a fountain on a mountain
     C
baby please

let’s laugh until we’re dead

[Interlude: ( Dm ) x8   ( Dm Am ) x4 ]

    Dm
you sneeze
                                  C
dandelion fluff flies through the air

and gets caught up in your hair
   Dm
we sleep

by a fountain on a mountain
     C
baby please

let’s laugh until we’re dead


 X    Dm
(you) sneeze
                                  C
dandelion fluff flies through the air

and gets caught up in your hair
    Dm
we sleep

by a fountain on a mountain
     C
baby please

let’s laugh until we’re dead
