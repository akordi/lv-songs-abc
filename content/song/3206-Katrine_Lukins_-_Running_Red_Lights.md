You tell me let go, let go of your fears Insanity keeps us awake
But then you go back, you disappear left me along the way

Said you’re sorry hope you mean it, cuz there’s a thousand things we’ve lost
Waking up 5 in the morning, you didn’t know what it would cost.

Thought I lose myself without you, but I’ve learned to fall without you
There’s no turning back now, I am on my way and I’m here to stay.

Oh you got all of me for such a long time, took all you could get, but now you can’t hide
I’m breaking you off, breaking you off
We’re running through the lights
We’re Running red lights, running red lights
I’m breaking you off, breaking you off
We’re running red lights

Oh I’ll let go, let go of the pain that I really thought was love
I know we will lose all the things we had
But there is so much we can’t undo

Said you’re sorry hope you mean it, cuz there’s a thousand things we’ve lost
Waking up 5 in the morning, you didn’t know what it would cost.

Thought I lose myself without you, but I’ve learned to fall without you
There’s no turning back now, I am on my way and I’m here to stay.

Oh you got all of me for such a long time, took all you could get, but now you can’t hide
I’m breaking you off, breaking you off
We’re running through the lights
We’re Running red lights, running red lights
I’m breaking you off, breaking you off
We’re running red lights
