Chorus:
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Yeah, oh, oh, oh,
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Verse 1:
A smelly catfish
Says "bongs away"
Another golden day
A smelly catfish
Goes all the way
Let's move out and play
Now, the stench has hit it down on you
Your nostrils feel the flu
Now, the stench has pulled one on you
An epidemic flu
But say yeah, say yeah, say yeah if you don't care

Chorus:
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Yeah, oh, oh, oh,
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Verse 2:
Smelly catfish
You're going down
I'll help you hit the ground
Smelly catfish
You make me frown
Let's take away your crown
See, the end is near, it's coming soon
Get ready for your doom
See, the end is clear, it's coming soon
Bow down and face your doom
And say yeah, say yeah, say yeah like you don't care

Chorus:
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Yeah, oh, oh, oh,
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Bridge:
It’s too stinky, too stinky, too stinky in here…

Chorus:
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Yeah, oh, oh, oh,
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
