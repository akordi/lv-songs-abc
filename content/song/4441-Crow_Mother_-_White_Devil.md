```text
I gently draw your years of soul
while you're wasting them alone

When you take my dirty soul to hell,
treat me well

White devil in black men shoes
Don't Know how to lie,
know how to loose


Only a small dose of salt
will lead you into the ground

When you take my dirty soul to hell,
treat me well


White devil in black men shoes
Don't Know how to lie,
know how to loose

I'll feed your empty mind with gold
While you'll become so blind and old

When you take my dirty soul to hell,
treat me well

White devil in black men shoes
Don't Know how to lie,
know how to loose

White devil in black men shoes
Don't Know how to lie,
know how to loose
