You say you’re with me, you say you’re ride or die
You’re talkin’ true love, the kind that you can’t buy
But when I’m down and calling, I get no reply
No-no-no
But even though I / know that you’re no good
I keep coming back, damn / I think I’m hooked
My mind’s so f***in' hazy, whenever I’m with you
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Yeah, holding onto you hurts, but I can’t seem to let go
Yeah, holding onto you hurts, but I, but I...

Can't let go
Yeah, holding onto you hurts, but I can’t seem to let go

You say you’re mine and / Your heart is mine to keep
Yet with all the fightin’ / I feel like enemies
But when we’re done talkin’ / we’re underneath the sheets
Oh-oh-oh
And even though I / know your every move
I walk in blindly every time / hoping like fool
You drive me f***in’ crazy, with the things you do
Oh-oh-oh-oh

I can’t seem to let go
