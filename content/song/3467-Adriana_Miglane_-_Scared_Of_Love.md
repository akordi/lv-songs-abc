```text
Sometimes I get scared of love
It just blows my mind
Gravity keeps pulling on, so let us collide
And now I need to fix my broken heart
Do it fast, before it falls apart
 
'Cause I never believed,
That I would love somebody like you
I never believed,
That you could love somebody like (love somebody like) me
 
We're imagining here
I feel it in my heart
No mountain high, no valley low
To keep us apart
And now I need to fix my broken heart
Do it fast, before it falls apart
 
'Cause I never believed,
That I would love somebody like you
I never believed,
That you could love somebody like me
 
I never believed, (Ooh)
That you could love somebody like you
I'd never even dream
That you could love somebody like (love somebody like)
 
And that you and I will walk together
And the love we find will last forever
We are goin' up, up, up, up
Never givin' up, up, up, up
We are goin' up, up, up, up
Never givin' up
 
'Cause I never believed,
That I would love somebody like you
I never believed,
That you could love somebody like me
I'd never even dream (Ooh)
That you could love somebody like you
I'd never even dream
That you could love somebody like
(love somebody like, love somebody like) me
