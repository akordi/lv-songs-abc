[F] As you see the [C] colors land upon [Am] everything you do, 
[G] It starts to make sense
[F] Simple things [C] like a balloon, if you [Am] let them away, 
[G] They'll stay beyond your fence

[F] You got [C] carried away from the [Am] streets of people [G] passing by 
[F] Somewhere far [C] I see the [Am] lights reflecting [G] in the sky
[F] My head surround [C] the sounds, I [Am] clearly hear them [G] calling me 

[F] As you see the [C] colors land upon [Am] everything you do, 
[G] It starts to make sense
[F] Simple things [C] like a balloon, if you [Am] let them away, 
[G] They'll stay beyond your fence

[F] And I never [C] had a doubt [Am] that I'll find my way,
[G] Looking from the top
[F] The world spins [C] around, I'm on a track, [Am] it goes around 
And I [G] swear to never stop.
