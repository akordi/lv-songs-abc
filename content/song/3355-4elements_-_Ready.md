Are you ready?
Baby now I am true,
I’m ready just for you.

Sometimes I try to analyze (analyze)
What I don’t seem to realize (realize).
You know what to say and when to smile
On all the occasions and all the while.
On my own I get off the track too much,
When I’m alone I’m missing out on touch.

I’m ready today, today I can say
The words you’re waiting for,
That all my life and all my love
Is ready just for you.

I’m ready today, today I can say
The words you’re waiting for,
That all my life and all my love
Is ready just for you.

You are an angel, but so am I,
Both on a wing, one wing to fly.
Let’s bring them together and off we go,
Riding our heavenly rodeo.
On my own I get off the track too much,
When I’m alone I’m missing out on touch.

I’m ready today, today I can say
The words you’re waiting for,
That all my life and all my love
Is ready just for you.

I’m ready today, today I can say
The words you’re waiting for,
That all my life and all my love
Is ready just for you.

Now that you hear what my heart is singing,
Now that you see what my eyes will shout,
Now that you feel that my words are valid.
Will you come over, will you come out?

I’m ready today, today I can say
The words you’re waiting for,
That all my life and all my love
Is ready just for you.

I’m ready today, today I can say
The words you’re waiting for,
That all my life and all my love
Is ready just for you.

I´m ready today.
