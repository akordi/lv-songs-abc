```text
Worlds collide 
Can’t look away
Look away

Blood red tears
On your face
On your face

Take me with you 
Never sleep 
Never sleep

Flesh to flesh
Make me complete
Me complete

So cast your spell all over me
Drown me in your lungs
Winter Love
Winter Love
I’ll wait here for a thousand years
To feel you in my blood
Winter Love
Winter Love

Hold me close 
Never let me go
Let me go 

Fall into oblivion
That no one knows
No one knows

Taste my lips
Do you believe 
You believe

This helpless heartbeat
Destiny Destiny

Oooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh ooh
```
