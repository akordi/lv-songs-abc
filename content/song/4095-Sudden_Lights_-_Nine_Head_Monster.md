```text
city never sleeps she keeps her treasures
she's nine head monster spitting fiery flames
she dives deep in violet sea of million pleasures
where swim those souls who have lost their aim and 
surname

hello hello welcome to my world
feel loneliness  feel nights  feel never ending fights
feel tireless lights  nothing wrong and nothing right 
feel life

city never sleeps she keeps her treasures
she's nine head monster spitting fiery flames
topless girls midnight calls, drugman falls  can't 
resist it all
always lies oversized girl goes by  isn't it time to 
rise

hello hello welcome to my world
feel loneliness  feel nights  feel never ending fights
feel tireless lights  nothing wrong and nothing right

hello hello welcome to my world

hello hello welcome to my world
feel loneliness  feel nights  feel never ending fights
feel tireless lights  nothing wrong and nothing right
```
