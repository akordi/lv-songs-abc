My lucky day is just this day today
I got a message, most surprising SMS
My Grandma, she’s an angel far away
Sends me tender love from heaven above

It can’t be true! – I’m not fooling you
Grandma is asking: “Do you know the tune?”

Sing it, swing it, do it now
Come along and swing tonight!
Sing it, swing it, now you know:
It’s really great! There’s so much fun!

I can’t believe it’s happening with me
This melody can really make me feel so free
It seems that I can dance and scat and step
Will you dance alone or join in with me?

Would you dance with me? – Would you dance with me?
What should I do now? Come together!

Sing it, swing it, do it now
Come along and swing tonight!
Sing it, swing it, now you know:
It’s really great! There’s so much fun!

Sing it, swing it, do it now
Come along and swing tonight!
Sing it, swing it, now you know:
You feel the style! You make me smile!

Can you see me swinging, sweet Grandma?
Who is doing it today?
Look, may be angels up in the sky
Doing better than us

Swinging up and down our life goes on
Like it used to be in Grandma’s blissful past
On Monday we are happy still we know:
On Tuesday we can fall and lose the control

When I fall in love… – When I fall in love
I’m bit crazy, we can only…

Sing it, swing it, do it now
Come along and swing tonight!
Sing it, swing it, now you know:
It’s really great! There’s so much fun!

Sing it, swing it, do it now
Come along and swing tonight!
Sing it, swing it, now you know:
It’s really great! There’s so much fun!

Sing it, swing it, do it now
Come along and swing tonight!
Sing it, swing it, now you know:
You feel the style! You make me smile!
Sing it, swing it, make me smile!
