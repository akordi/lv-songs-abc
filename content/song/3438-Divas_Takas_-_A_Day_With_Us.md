```text
When you feel alone
and social media makes you sad
Remember about your friends
They will make you feel better
You are not alone on this winter day
You can spend it with us
We can do nothing at all
at least we'll be together

A day wasted on others
Is not wasted on one's self
A day wasted on others
Is not wasted on one's self

We know each other well
We've done so many things together
From traveling to snow man building
Fun or serious
Let's celebrate Christmas together
We'll waste this day too
It's the only present I need
To be with you

A day wasted on others
Is not wasted on one's self
A day wasted on others
Is not wasted on one's self

We'll watch Christmas movies
Sing, eat, laugh and tell stories
This is gonna be great
To be with you
On Christmas day

A day wasted on others
Is not wasted on one's self
A day wasted on others
Is not wasted on one's self

A day wasted on others
Is not wasted on one's self
A day wasted on others
Is not wasted on one's self
