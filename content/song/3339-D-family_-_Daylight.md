```text
Night, no one ever talks at night
Darkness hardly gives advice
Quietly it rolls the dice
There’s no time but running sand

Come, silence’s hard to bear alone
Darkness has no word to say
Two is power to obey
Two is better anyway

Daylight will shelter us once more
Three words we’ve heard before
Those words that are spoken by time
Despite of silence without cause and hesitation walls
We simply chat away just because

Morn came rather grey and bleak today
Mirror mirror on the wall
Tell me where it all has gone
Nightly kisses I adore

So music played by you is gone
Dawn keeps secert of the night
Quiet touch of misty lips
Paved the way for our good bye

Daylight will shelter us once more
Three words we’ve heard before
Those words that are spoken by time
Despite of silence without cause and hesitation walls
We simply chat away just because

Daylight will shelter us once more
Three words we’ve heard before
Those words that are spoken by time
Despite of silence without cause and hesitation walls
We simply chat away just because

Daylight
