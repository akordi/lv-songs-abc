```text
Can’t let you go
Can’t let you go

I was wrong
Thought I can let you go
And live without your hello

Yes, you did me wrong
But it seems so long ago
The pain is gone, we face new dawn

I wanna run, run, run to you
And race with angels like a fool
Be out of time, win speed of light
Stand by your side

I wanna run, run, run to you
As fast as I can do
Be out of time, win speed of light
Stand by your side

We were strong
Denied we will ever fall
And wake up here all alone, alone

We both created storm
Tried different flavours on
But one is sure, less is more
Less is more

I wanna run, run, run to you
And race with angels like a fool
Be out of time, win speed of light
Stand by your side

I wanna run, run, run to you
As fast as I can do
Be out of time, win speed of light
Stand by your side

(I wanna run, run, run to you) I wanna run to you
(And race with angels like a fool) Race with angels like a fool
(Be out of time, win speed of light) Oh…
(Stand by your side)

I wanna run, run, run to you
As fast as I can do
Be out of time, win speed of light
Stand by your side
