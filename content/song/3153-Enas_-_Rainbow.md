E A9 E A9
You said you don't like the people watching on you 
E A9 E A9 
You said you don't like sun rise 
E A9 E A9 
You said you don't like shadows in the night 
E A9 H 
You said you don't like to fall down 
A H 
Then give me your hand and I'll help you 
G# C#m G# A H 
Get out of there. Just call my name; and I'll be there 
E A H A 
I can be your rainbow in the night and in the day 
H E A H A 
Can I be your rainbow in your joy and in your pain 
H G# C#m G# A E A9 ... 
I will be your rainbow just be my flame 

You said you don't like a freeze in the winter 
You said you don't like drunk people 
You said you don't like to sleep in the nightmare 
You said you don't like to feel broke
