*zemais sitiens, augstais sitiens ar plaukstām - 4 taktis (2 sitieni katrā - 6/8 taktsmērs)*

G     C          Em D   G
Lovers scattered on the floor
B      C
Stolen time
G      D
Stolen horse

G     C          Em  D   G
Ride around the fragrant room
B   C  Em  D
Flower in bloom

*turpinās D*
Violet

G      C     Em   D     G
Like a sigh to my naked eye
B     C      G      D
But my eyes are not shy
G  C   Em  D   G
I want to see you
B   C   Em  D
            Violet

C            F             C
   She comes softly like a breeze
       F
Like a ghost
        C
Falling leaves
         Gm            Dm
Like the silence after violence
       F              C
In the last light of day

Dm Am Em F

Dm          Am
Through the window 
Em                F
Past the steering wheel
Dm          Em
Beneath the knees
Am             G
As the faithful kneel
Dm     Am     Em           F
Riding inter-cities on the train
Dm     Em
At the edge
Am       G
Of usual gray
 Dm                        Em 
Between the lines of poetry
    F                             G
In all the places spirits are seen
Am
Violet
G

Like the silence after violence
       F              C
In the last light of day
