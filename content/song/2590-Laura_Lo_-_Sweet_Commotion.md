[Am] Close your [C] eyes and I will sing you 
[F] Till you sleep, till you [C] dream
[Am] And I [C] won’t let you [F] down
[C] Trust me
[Am] And I’ll [C] be there [F] in your every,
Every [C] heartbeat

[Am] You can say go away 
But I won’t leave you here
[C] I love [F] you   
Time stood [C] still..

[Am] You can say go away 
But I won’t leave you here
[C] I love [F] you   
Time stood [C] still..

[Am] And if you don’t [C] believe, and if you don’t trust [F] me 
Than look in my [C] eyes - they will tell you truth 

[C] Eyes, [Am] eyes .. 
[F] They will tell you [C] truth..

[C] Eyes, [Am] eyes .. 
[F] They will tell you [C] truth..

[Am] Close your [C] eyes and I will sing you 
[F] Till you sleep, till you [C] dream
[Am] And I [C] won’t let you [F] down
[C] Trust me
[Am] And I’ll [C] be there [F] in your every,
Every [C] heartbeat
