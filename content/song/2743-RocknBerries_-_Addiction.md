```text
Too many wise men all around me 
Sententious thoughts expressed out loud 
Confusion leads to desperation 
I find myself down on the ground  
I know you’re with me 
Don't let me down 
Why do you tease me?  
I need you 
To grab me and take me to 
The only place where 
I see through 
The wall of dust in front of view  
I can’t resist addiction 
To your presence by my side 
Love is my obsession  
All your wills I'll satisfy 
Temptation has no limits 
Release me and make me fly  
There’s no justice and no mercy 
No one’s there to cure your pain 
Human mindless fight for glory 
Slowly drives me insane
```
