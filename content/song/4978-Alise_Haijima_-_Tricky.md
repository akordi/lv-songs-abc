[Chorus]
Tricky, tricky is showing now
Please, stand aloud
See your colors now
Know what you're about
Tricky, tricky, that's your vibe
Part of the tribe
Once you're inside
It's a tricky way to fly
 
[Verse 1]
Tonight is on
So right and wrong
Expectations gone
Rhythm like a song
Always weepy
I'll make you see
Make the change to who we used to be
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Now you're on a mission, try to lose your inhibition
It's my sole ambition to be what you need
Dangerous and cheeky
Are we getting tricky?
On the roll of the die
Is where you caught my eye
 
[Chorus]
Tricky, tricky is showing now
Please, stand aloud
See your colors now
Know what you're about
Tricky, tricky, that's your vibe
Part of the tribe
Once you're insidе
It's a tricky way to fly
 
[Verse 2]
Haters be clapping, they can't see what I'm worth
'Causе I'm the real deal
I'm 'bout to show you more
Up on my heels, up on my heels
Lookin' so fancy, am I not real?
Up on my bills, up on my bills
I don't need no creature, I'm a queen
 
[Verse 3]
So fresh style, bet you gonna see me rollin' (Woah)
Bow down, 'cause I'm coming for the throne
They hated me and my name, name
Need no money, all of my initials
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Now you're on a mission, try to lose your inhibition
It's my sole ambition to be what you need
Dangerous and cheeky
Are we getting tricky?
On the roll of the die
Is where you caught my eye
 
[Chorus]
Tricky, tricky is showing now
Please, stand aloud
See your colors now
Know what you're about
Tricky, tricky, that's your vibe
Part of the tribe
Once you're inside
It's a tricky way to fly
 
[Post-Chorus]
You're so tricky
So, so tricky
Got me dissin'
I've been tricky, tricky
Talk so tricky, he's so tricky
Just leave quickly
It's getting tricky, tricky
I've been tricky, tricky
[Bridge]
Talk so tricky, he's so tricky
Just leave quickly
It's getting tricky, tricky
 
[Chorus]
Tricky, tricky is showing now
Please, stand aloud
See your colors now
Know what you're about
Tricky, tricky, that's your vibe
Part of the tribe
Once you're inside
It's a tricky way to fly
Tricky, tricky is showing now
Please, stand aloud
See your colors now
Know what you're about
Tricky, tricky, that's your vibe
Part of the tribe
Once you're inside
It's a tricky way to fly
 
[Outro]
You're so tricky
So, so tricky
Got me dissin'
It's getting tricky, tricky
Talk so tricky, he's so tricky
Just leave quickly
It's getting tricky, tricky (Yeah)
