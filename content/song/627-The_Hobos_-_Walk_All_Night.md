Ab Gm Bb


        Cm
Now you treat me kindly
Gm                   Ab
Stuck in a traffic - here is the schedule
                      Cm                  Bb    
Ignore the red light, don't let them pass you.
                 Ab
Are you tired or not? 
            Eb                    Bb       
Ain't gonna let you sleep, you'll come with me
      Cm              Ab  Eb Bb   
We're gonna waste our time
                  Cm
Gonna take a walk all night
                         Gm               Ab        
Hear the stranger voices, see them people painting
               Cm              Bb
On the fences, they are writing
             Ab
That big old OM.


         Eb                Bb
And then again against the wall
         Cm                Ab          Eb  Bb           
they are scooping out that 16 year old girl
                 Cm
Who's whispering sigh

         Ab     Cm       Eb         Bb
We gonna take a walk all night, all night...
         Ab     Cm       Eb         Bb   Cm   Ab   Eb   Bb
We gonna take a walk... 

Cm           Bb                 Ab
Cigaretes oh cigaretes, chain's straining
                      Cm
Don't you worry now - see the morning
     Bb        Ab
Snow up in the mountain tops.
         Eb               Bb
They are higher, they can see
         Cm               Ab
As we're walking down the streets
            Eb  Bb                  Cm
Wasting our time, gonna take a walk all night. 



 Ab  Gm  Bb  Cm  Eb
