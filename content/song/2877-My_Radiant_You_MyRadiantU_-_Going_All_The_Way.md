```text
Take of my shoes I kneal in the dirt
I give you keys to my kingdom of hurt
This crown is just a faux refflection
Tonight you are my only affection

I was born to be with you
I was born to give it back to you

Light up a match and set it on fire
Burn up the heart of this righteous liar
This prayer is stuck on my lips
Can you hear me?

Blinded by lights of this summer night
Cought in a moment with you by my side
All I've been, all i've seen
All i have, all my dreams
Give it back to you,
Give it back to you

I'm going all the way
I give you everything
There is no turning back
Won't ever be afraid
I'm going all the way

Oooo,
Oooo

Take of my shoes i kneal in the dirt
I give you keys yo my kingdom of hurt
Take of my shoes Take of my crown
This place i'm standing on...

I'm going all the way
I give you everything
There is no turning back
Won't ever be afraid
I'm going all the way
