Pieces falling
That hold us together
Chances we take
That turn us for better

It’s a road that never end
And leads to something we call a friend
And no matter how far I will know where you are
I will never stop being your friend
And I never will

‘Cause you’re my friend when I’m down and blue
‘Cause you’re my friend, I can count on you
Your heart has turned around and I’m blessed that I know
You are my friend, are my friend, I can count on you, ooh…

Show them the best of you
I’ll make you dare
Believe me, when it’s time to go
You know I will care

And when the time comes for us to part
Oh, I really want you to know
That no matter how far I will know where you are
I will never stop being your friend
And I never will, oh…

‘Cause you’re my friend when I’m down and blue
‘Cause you’re my friend, I can count on you
Your heart has turned around and I’m blessed that I know
You are my friend, are my friend

‘Cause you’re my friend when I’m down and blue
‘Cause you’re my friend, I can count on you
Your heart has turned around and I’m blessed that I know
You are my friend, are my friend, you are my friend

I can count on you
