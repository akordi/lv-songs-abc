[C] Just one look
Just one your look [Am] bring me to [F] heaven
[C] Your smile
Just one smile
[Am] Light the fire in [F] my heart

[C] Your touch
Just one touch
[Am] Make goosebumps on [F] my skin
[C] Just you, only [Am] you make my [F] fly

  [C] I'll be [G] waiting for you
  [Am][C] Only you
  [F] Are you [G] with me 
  Are [C] you

  [C] I'll be [G] waiting for you
  [Am][C] Only you
  [F] Are you [G] with me 
  Are [C] you

[F] When i'm [G] alone and sad
i [Am] close my eyes
And i'm with you in my dreams

[F] When i'm [G] alone and sad
i [Am] close my eyes
And i'm with you in my dreams

[F] With you
[G] With you in my [C] dreams

  [C] I'll be [G] waiting for you
  [Am][C] Only you
  [F] Are you [G] with me 
  Are [C] you

  [C] I'll be [G] waiting for you
  [Am][C] Only you
  [F] Are you [G] with me 
  Are [C] you
