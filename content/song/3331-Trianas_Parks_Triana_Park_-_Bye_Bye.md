Daddy stay away, mother please don’t cry
I wanna feel the steam and I wanna fly high
I wanna do the things that I never did, no
I wanna feel the rhythm of the big brand show, so

I just wanna live
I just wanna go bye bye
I just wanna live
I just wanna go bye bye

Too many names there are on the display
Too many different words I don’t know which way
They lead me, they guide me, I move too slow
I really, really, really, really got to go, so

I just wanna live
I just wanna go bye bye
I just wanna live
I just wanna go bye bye

This is not a game, this is not a show, no
This is a reality where things come and go
This is not a game, this is not a show, no
This is a reality where things come and go

I just wanna know
I just wanna go bye bye
I just wanna live
I just wanna go bye bye

I just wanna live
I just wanna live
I just wanna live, I wanna see the world
I wanna feel the brightness of enlightenment of the mind

Millions of people live in Hong Kong
We are standing on together singing different song
Tomorrow sun is coming to take us away
Tomorrow I am going to learn how to play, so

I just wanna know, I just wanna know why, why
I just wanna leave, I just wanna go bye bye
I just wanna know, I just wanna know why, why
I just wanna leave, I just wanna go bye bye
