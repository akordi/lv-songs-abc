Oooo! Oooo! O! O!
Oooo! Oooo! O! O!
Oooo! Oooo! O! O!
 
What if I
Did not pick up
High and dry
With no heads up
 
Baby
Tell me there's another way to see this
You played me
Once what a huge mistake
But now it's twice
Don't give a f*ck
 
I won't call you
Sooo don't pick up the phone
Noooo explaining
Noooo excuses
 
I won't call you
Sooo don't pick up the phone
Oooo! Oooo! O! O!
Oooo! Oooo! O! O!
 
I'm cutting the wire
I'm cutting the wire
I'm cutting the wire (wire, wire)
It's what you desire
 
I'm cutting the wire
I'm cutting the wire
I'm cutting the wire (wire, wire)
It's what you desire
 
So just go!
Oooo! Oooo! O! O!
Oooo! Oooo! O! O!
 
What if I
Have never seen
All this sh*t
You've done to me
 
Baby
Did you think you got away with it?
You blame me
'Cause you claim I pulled away
This is it
You're such a d*ck
 
I'm cutting the wire
I'm cutting the wire
I'm cutting the wire (wire, wire)
It's what you desire [x4]
 
So just go!
Oooo! Oooo! O! O!
Oooo! Oooo! O! O!
Oooo! Oooo! O! O!
Oooo! Oooo! O! O!
