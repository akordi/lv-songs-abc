[Intro]
Eo, I said eo
I get lalala love vibes
Lalalala from you
Eo, I said eo
I get lalala love vibes
Lalalala from you

[Verse 1]
I felt that I'm all alone
In a place so cold, no love
I had nowhere else to go
She came to me like a dream
Like an angel I haven’t seen
She sang to me sweet melody


[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna let you go now
I think you're my destiny
Trying to show me something
I don’t really wanna see
I don't wanna let you go now
Will you remember me?
I'm counting all my blessings
I'm counting all my blessings
Living in the world of possibilities (Possibilities)
I know (I know) that I (That I) will see you again

[Chorus]
Eo, I said eo
I get lalala love vibes
Lalalala from you
Eo, I said eo
I get lalala love vibes
Lalalala from you

[Verse 2]
I need a place where I belong
My love for you grows strong
God, I wish I would see you again

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna let you go now
I think you're my destiny
Trying to show me something
I don't really wanna see
I don't wanna let you go now
Will you remember me?
I’m counting all my blessings
I’m counting all my blessings
Living in the world of possibilities (Possibilities)
I know (I know) that I (That I) will see you again (Hey)

I get lalala love vibes
Lalalala from you
