```text
I am afraid
Of losing the game
‘Cause you are the prize
I wanna roll the magic dice

You make me alive
And you take me high
‘Cause you are the prize
I wanna roll the magic dice

To paradise, paradise
I was afraid
But now I’d never trade

Oh whoa… oh whoa…
Oh whoa… oh whoa…

I was afraid
But now I’d never trade

I rolled the dice
And I took your advice
I paid my price
You can never go there twice

To paradise, paradise
I was afraid
But now I’d never trade

Paradise, ah…
Paradise, ah…
Oh… you can never go there twice

Oh whoa… oh whoa…
Oh whoa… oh whoa…

I was afraid
But now I’d never trade
