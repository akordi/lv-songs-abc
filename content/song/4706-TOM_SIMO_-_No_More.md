```text
You saw me one time
When i was so unbreakable
I trusted you for a while
And then came the truth

You said me those good things
Your body was powerful
But then came the day
When....

I said no more,
You need to go,
So I can’t see you
Oh, no more

Days went, none one knew
Why I did that to you
But I stand and say
STOP!

I said no more,
You need to to,
So I can’t see you
Oh, no more

I said no more,
You need to to,
So I can’t see you
Oh, no more

Ones saw, others laugh
I was alone and that was all
We saw the things
Why we fell in love 
But then....

I said no more,
You need to to,
So I can’t see you
Oh, no more

I said no more,
You need to to,
So I can’t see you
Oh, no more
