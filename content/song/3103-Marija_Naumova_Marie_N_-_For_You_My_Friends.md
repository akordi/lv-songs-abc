One day you’ll understand that you are alone
And the world around you, cold and firm like stone
And that’s the miracle, you’ll need a real friend
To whom you do not have to lie and to pretend

And that’s the miracle, you’ll need a real friend
To whom you do not have to lie and to pretend

You have to stop for a moment
You have to wait for a while
Remember all the friends you’ve needed
To say to them thanks and then to smile

You have to stop for a moment
You have to wait for a while
Remember all the friends you’ve needed
To say to them thanks and then to smile

You’ll see all people in another way
In your life, it won’t be a hard and heavy day
And that’s the important day, you’ll need a real friend
The tell that you are tired, to lie and to pretend

And that’s the important day, you’ll need a real friend
The tell that you’re tired, to lie and to pretend

You have to stop for a moment
You have to wait for a while
Remember all the friends you’ve needed
To say to them thanks and then to smile

You have to stop for a moment
You have to wait for a while
Remember all the friends you’ve needed
To say to them thanks and then to smile

You have to stop for a moment
You have to wait for a while
Remember all the friends you’ve needed
To say to them thanks and then to smile

You have to stop for a moment
You have to wait for a while
Remember all the friends you’ve needed
To say to them thanks and then to smile
