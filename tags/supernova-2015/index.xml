to make me feel like I am home There are so many colours and blinding lights to see So beautiful and gracious, you know but only she knows how Knows how to make me feel like I am home Thank you for the life you gave me with your heart Thank you for your love Finally I feel like I can really start Spread my wings and fly above my fears There are so many chances to take, but I’m not sure Of disappointment later and what it’s really for, but she Knows how to make me feel like I am home, home Feels like I’m home and I’m home Thank you for the life you gave me with your heart Thank you for your love Finally I feel like I can really start Spread my wings and fly above Time goes by but there’s no place I’d rather be And I hope I found a decent melody For the song to describe how I feel About you, about love, about family Thank you for the life you gave me with your heart Thank you for your love (Thank you for your love) I can feel it’s time Spread my wings and fly above my fears</description></item><item><title>Lions</title><link>http://example.org/song/3092-Lana_Franceska_-_Lions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2017 10:23:10

Diamonds Will light up the skies and find us What we rushed to lose too fast Thinking that it would just last Lions In our hearts we’ll find our lions They’ll never let us fall They’ll guard the light that brings us home Through the night, through the time We’ll stand hand in hand, we’ll fight side by side Through the night, like the lions that we are Sunrise We have dreamed a dream of sunrise When the morning finally comes We’ll hear the call of love Silence When our words will turn to silence We’ll find the call of love We’ll hear the call of love Lions Come and gather all my lions Through the night, through the time We’ll stand hand in hand, we’ll fight side by side Through the night, through the time We’ll stand hand in hand, we’ll fight side by side Through the night, like the lions that we are (Through the night, time by time)</description></item><item><title>Free Your Mind</title><link>http://example.org/song/3082-The_Stones_-_Free_Your_Mind/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2017 10:12:50
