If you wanna see who can make you happy Look in the mirror If you wanna see who can make you happy Look in the mirror If you wanna see who can make you happy Look in the mirror I know I don’t have to wait long Till I’ll be free from this need To have something that gives me relief I’m learning to love life as it is Waiting for the perfect lover Who will come and make my grief go away But I know it’s too much to ask I’ll just deal with my demons alone If you wanna see who can make you happy Look in the mirror If you wanna see who can make you happy Look in the mirror If you wanna see who can make you happy Look in the mirror I know I don’t have to wait long Till I’ll be free from this need To have something that gives me relief I’m learning to love I know I don’t have to wait long Till I’ll be free from this need To have something that gives me relief I’m learning to love life as it is Ooh yeah yeah… Till I’ll be free from this need I’m learning to love, I’m learning to love I know

Funny how the smallest thing can alter everything Endless possibilities Different you, different me One step here and one step there You are closer now and further than you’ve ever been Every single choice you make Every single step you take The ink you leave’s indelible Choices, choices Every little word you say Every promise that you break The ink you leave’s indelible Choices, choices There’s always, there’s always There’s always and always and always a choice There’s always, there’s always There’s always and always and always a choice Endless possibilities Different you, different me You can stay or walk away But you’ll never know for sure how it all would have been Every single choice you make Every single step you take The ink you leave’s indelible Choices, choices There’s always (Choices) There’s always a choice There’s always, there’s always There’s always and always a choice There’s always, there’s always There’s always and always and always a choice There’s always, there’s
