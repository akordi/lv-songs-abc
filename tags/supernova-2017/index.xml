I should tell myself until I learn.</description></item><item><title>Little Weird</title><link>http://example.org/song/2879-Laura_Lo_-_Little_Weird/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2017 20:12:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/song/2879-Laura_Lo_-_Little_Weird/</guid><description>[C] Late night walking [Am] around in this old [F] city [G] [C] Neon lights are [Am] flashing on your [F] perfect skin [G] [C] You don’t even [Am] know that I’m watching your [F] every move [G] Just [C] talking, walking, [Am] laughing, talking - [F] round and round [G] Cause I’m [Am] feeling a little [F] weird [C] looking into [G] your eyes Cause I’m [Am] feeling a little [F] weird [C] looking into [G] your eyes And we [Am] dance with no [F] music And we [C] dream under [G] the stars [Am] Dance with no [F] music And we [C] dream under [G] the stars [C] Acting silly, feeling [Am] infinite You don’t [F] want to go home [G] [C] We don’t mind what the [Am] others say Cause we’re [F] having the best time [G] tonight And I’m [Am] feeling a little [F] weird [C] looking into [G] your eyes And I’m [Am] feeling a little [F] weird [C] looking into [G] your eyes And we [Am] dance with no [F] music And we [C] dream under [G] the stars [Am] Dance with no [F] music And we [C] dream under [G] the stars [Am] Floating somewhere in [F] the space [C] Floating somewhere in [G] the space [Am] Floating somewhere in [F] the space [C] Floating somewhere [G] And we [Am] dance with no [F] music And we [C] dream under [G] the stars [Am] Dance with no [F] music And we [C] dream under [G] the stars [Am] Dance with no [F] music And we [C] dream under [G] the stars [Am] dance with no [F] music And we [C] dream under [G] the stars</description></item><item><title>All I Know</title><link>http://example.org/song/2876-My_Radiant_You_MyRadiantU_-_All_I_Know/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2017 06:50:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/song/2876-My_Radiant_You_MyRadiantU_-_All_I_Know/</guid><description>[C] I Left my home on a Sunday Hear the church bells ringing [Am] Got in my car started driving Driving till the end of road [C] I&amp;#39;ll send my love to you baby From a thousand miles away [Am] It&amp;#39;s like the water is rising And sky&amp;#39;s about to break All I [C] know You made me for a [Am] reason All I [F] know I find myself on my [G] knees again And now you want me to [C] stay I know you want me to [Am] stay Hey, hey!</description></item><item><title>Line</title><link>http://example.org/song/2873-Trianas_Parks_Triana_Park_-_Line/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2017 12:10:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/song/2873-Trianas_Parks_Triana_Park_-_Line/</guid><description>I’m going [F] round in [Em] circles And the [Am] door’s wide [G] open Boy I [F] still wanna see [Em] you Days go [Am] by, I’m still hoping, [G] hoping [F] Where we draw the line?
